# Sequential Thinking MCP Server Fix

## Problem
When using the sequential-thinking MCP server, the tool results were displaying as raw JSON instead of formatted output, making it difficult for users to understand the thinking progress.

## Root Cause
1. The `mcp-tools-context.ts` was using generic JSON.stringify for non-array results
2. The sequential thinking server returns an object with specific fields that need special formatting
3. The AI analysis after tool execution wasn't providing meaningful context for sequential thinking

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced Tool Result Formatting
Updated `lib/mcp/mcp-tools-context.ts` to detect sequential thinking results and format them nicely:

```typescript
// Special handling for sequential thinking results
if (toolCall.tool === 'sequentialthinking' && typeof result === 'object' && !Array.isArray(result)) {
  const thinking = result as any
  formattedResult += `ðŸ§  **Sequential Thinking Progress**\n\n`
  formattedResult += `**Thought ${thinking.thoughtNumber || 1} of ${thinking.totalThoughts || '?'}**\n\n`
  
  // Display the current thought if available
  if (thinking.thought) {
    formattedResult += `${thinking.thought}\n\n`
  }
  
  // Show progress if available
  if (thinking.progress && thinking.progress.length > 0) {
    formattedResult += `**Progress:**\n`
    thinking.progress.forEach((item: string, index: number) => {
      formattedResult += `${index + 1}. ${item}\n`
    })
    formattedResult += '\n'
  }
  
  // Show continuation status
  if (thinking.nextThoughtNeeded !== undefined) {
    formattedResult += thinking.nextThoughtNeeded 
      ? `ðŸ”„ More thinking needed... (${thinking.thoughtHistoryLength || 1} thoughts so far)\n` 
      : `âœ… Thinking complete!\n`
  }
}
```

### 2. Improved AI Analysis
Updated `app/api/chat/route.ts` to provide better analysis instructions for sequential thinking:

- Detects when sequential thinking tool is used
- Provides context-aware analysis explaining:
  - Current thinking status
  - What sequential thinking means
  - How it addresses the user's question
  - Next steps or conclusions

## Testing

1. Ensure the sequential-thinking server is added to your MCP servers
2. Send a message that triggers sequential thinking (e.g., "Think step by step about...")
3. Verify the results show formatted output with progress indicators
4. Confirm the AI provides meaningful analysis after tool execution

## Expected Output

Instead of raw JSON:
```json
{
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "totalThoughts": 5,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
  "progress": [],
  "thoughtHistoryLength": 1
}
```

Users now see:
```
ðŸ§  **Sequential Thinking Progress**

**Thought 1 of 5**

ðŸ”„ More thinking needed... (1 thoughts so far)
```

Followed by AI analysis explaining the thinking process and how it relates to their question.

# Auto-Submit Fix for Analyze Image Button

## Problem
When clicking the "Analyze" button after uploading an image, the message text was being populated but not automatically sent. Users had to manually click the send button.

## Root Cause
The functions were calling `originalHandleSubmit` instead of the custom `handleSubmit` function. The `handleSubmit` function properly handles file attachments and submission logic, while `originalHandleSubmit` is just the raw function from the hook.

## Fixed Functions
1. **handleInlineImageOptionSelect** - Fixed analyze case
2. **handleAnimateConfirm** - Fixed animate submission
3. **handleImageOptionSelect** - Fixed both analyze and animate cases

## Changes Made
```typescript
// Before
originalHandleSubmit(event)

// After
handleSubmit()
```

Also updated all dependency arrays to include `handleSubmit` instead of `originalHandleSubmit`.

## Test Instructions
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Upload an image by clicking the attachment icon
3. Click the "üîç Analyze" button that appears above the input
4. The message should be sent automatically with the image attached

## Expected Behavior
- Input field populates with "Analyze this image and provide a detailed analysis"
- Message is sent immediately without requiring manual send
- Image remains attached during submission
- Analysis response appears in chat

## Additional Fixes
The same fix was applied to:
- Animate button in InlineImageOptions
- ImageOptionsCard actions (when no text is provided with upload)
- Dialog confirmations for edit and animate actions

# Tool Status Fix Complete

## Problem Fixed
Tools were incorrectly showing as "completed" immediately with empty/undefined results when they should have been showing as "executing".

## Root Cause
In `hooks/use-chat-with-tools.ts`, the code was:
1. Setting tool status to 'completed' when parsing tool declarations
2. Trying to parse execution results from tool declarations (which don't contain results)

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Tool Status (line 126)
Changed from:
```typescript
status: 'completed', // Since execution happens inside, it's already completed
```

To:
```typescript
status: 'executing', // Tool declaration found, execution pending
```

### 2. Removed Incorrect Result Parsing (lines 131-172)
- Removed logic that tried to parse execution results from tool declarations
- Tool declarations are just requests to execute tools, not results
- Results come separately after tools are actually executed

## Testing
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Test with queries that trigger tools:
   - "What is the latest news about AI?"
   - "What is veo 3?"
   - "Search for information about GPT-4"

## Expected Behavior
- Tools show with spinner/loading animation (executing state)
- No more "undefined" or empty results
- Tools indicate they are actually running
- Results will appear when the tool execution completes

## Note
This fix improves the immediate user experience by showing the correct status. Full tool execution and result display requires the server-side execution to complete and communicate results back to the client.

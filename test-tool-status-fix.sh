echo "This script verifies that tools show as 'executing' instead of 'completed'."

echo "What was fixed:"
echo "- Tools no longer show as 'completed' immediately"
echo "- Removed 'undefined' display for results"
echo "- Tools now show proper 'executing' status with spinner"
echo ""
echo "Test Steps:"
echo "1. Start dev server: npm run dev"
echo "2. Open http://localhost:3000"
echo "3. Ask questions that trigger tools:"

echo "   - 'What is veo 3?' (triggers Context7)"
echo "   - 'Calculate 25 * 4' (triggers calculator if available)"

echo "Expected Results:"
echo "✓ Tool shows with spinning/loading animation"
echo "✓ Status shows as 'executing' not 'completed'"
echo "✓ No 'undefined' or empty results shown"
echo "✓ Tool appears to be actively running"

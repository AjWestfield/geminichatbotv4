echo "==========================="
echo ""
echo "This script helps test the audio timestamps in the file preview modal"
echo ""
echo "Steps to test:"
echo "1. Start the dev server: npm run dev"
echo "2. Open the app in your browser"
echo "3. Upload an audio file (MP3, WAV, etc.)"
echo "4. Wait for transcription to complete"
echo "5. Click on the audio file attachment in the chat"
echo ""
echo "Expected behavior in the File Preview Modal:"
echo "✓ Modal opens with audio player at top"
echo "✓ Two tabs appear below: 'Full Transcript' and 'Timed Segments'"
echo "✓ Full Transcript tab shows complete text"
echo "✓ Timed Segments tab shows timestamps with text"
echo "✓ Timestamps are blue and clickable"
echo "✓ Clicking timestamp seeks audio to that position"
echo "✓ Active segment highlights when playing"
echo ""
echo "What should NOT happen:"
echo "✗ No timestamps tab in Canvas view (right panel)"
echo "✗ Timestamps should only be in the file modal"
echo ""
echo "Debug tips:"
echo "- Open browser console (F12) for logs"
echo "- Look for 'FilePreviewModal - file data:' log"
echo "- Check that transcription.segments array exists"

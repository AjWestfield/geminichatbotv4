# Fixes Summary - v3

## 1. Sequential Thinking MCP Server Fix
**Problem**: Tool executed but results showed as raw JSON, AI analysis was cut off
**Solution**: 
- Fixed tool call parsing in `app/api/chat/route.ts` - now passes correct string to parser
- Enhanced result formatting in `lib/mcp/mcp-tools-context.ts` for sequential thinking
- Improved frontend parsing in `hooks/use-chat-with-tools.ts`
- Added special analysis instructions for sequential thinking

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/chat/route.ts`
- `lib/mcp/mcp-tools-context.ts`
- `hooks/use-chat-with-tools.ts`

## 2. Audio Transcription Error Fix
**Problem**: Connection reset error (ECONNRESET) with generic error message
**Solution**:
- Added toast notifications using Sonner
- Enhanced error handling with specific messages for different error types
- Added timeout and retry configuration to OpenAI client
- Better error categorization (connection, timeout, API key, file size)

**Files Modified**:
- `components/chat-interface.tsx` - Added toast notifications
- `app/api/transcribe/route.ts` - Enhanced error detection
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added Sonner provider

## 3. Transcription Timestamps Tab Restoration
**Problem**: Timestamps tab was missing from Canvas view
**Solution**:
- Added transcription state management in main page
- Pass transcription data from ChatInterface to CanvasView
- Added Timestamps tab with formatted segment display
- Clear transcription when file is removed

**Files Modified**:
- `app/page.tsx` - Added transcription state
- `components/chat-interface.tsx` - Added onTranscriptionReceived callback
- `components/canvas-view.tsx` - Added Timestamps tab with segments display

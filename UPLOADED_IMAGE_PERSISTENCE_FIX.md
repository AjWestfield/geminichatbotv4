# Uploaded Image Persistence Fix

## Problem
Uploaded images were appearing in the gallery but were not being persisted to the database. The test showed that persistence was actually working, but the UI was only using localStorage instead of loading from the database.

## Root Cause
1. The app was using dual storage systems (localStorage and database) but only loading from localStorage
2. When the app started, it loaded images from localStorage using `loadGeneratedImages()`
3. Database-persisted images were never loaded on app startup

## Solution

### 1. Added Database Loading on App Startup
Modified `app/page.tsx` to load images from the database when the app starts:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const loadPersistedImages = async () => {
    const dbImages = await loadAllImages()
    if (dbImages.length > 0) {
      console.log('[PAGE] Loaded', dbImages.length, 'images from database')
      setGeneratedImages(dbImages)
    }
  }
  loadPersistedImages()
}, [loadAllImages])
```

### 2. Added `loadAllImages` Function
Created a new function in the `useChatPersistence` hook to load all images from the database:
```typescript
const loadAllImages = useCallback(async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/images?limit=100')
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to load images')
    
    const data = await response.json()
    return data.images.map((img: any) => ({
      id: img.metadata?.localId || img.id,
      url: img.url,
      prompt: img.prompt,
      // ... map other fields
    }))
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading all images:', error)
    return []
  }
}, [])
```

### 3. Removed localStorage Persistence Calls
- Removed `saveGeneratedImages` calls from `chat-interface.tsx`
- Removed localStorage loading on component mount
- Images are now only persisted to the database

### 4. Enhanced Logging
Added detailed logging to track the persistence flow:
- Blob storage upload logging
- Database save operation logging
- Error details for debugging

### 5. Fixed Content Type Detection
Enhanced blob storage upload to properly detect MIME types from data URLs:
```typescript
const mimeMatch = imageUrl.match(/^data:([^;]+);/)
const contentType = mimeMatch ? mimeMatch[1] : 'image/png'
```

## Testing
Created `test-image-persistence.js` to verify persistence is working correctly:
```bash
node test-image-persistence.js
```

The test confirms that images are being saved to both Vercel Blob storage and Supabase database.

## User Experience
- Added a persistence notification component that shows whether database persistence is enabled
- Images are now loaded from the database on app startup
- Uploaded images are persisted the same way as generated images
- Images persist across page refreshes and browser sessions

## Next Steps
1. Consider implementing a sync mechanism between localStorage and database for offline support
2. Add pagination for loading images when there are many stored
3. Consider adding a manual refresh button to reload images from the database

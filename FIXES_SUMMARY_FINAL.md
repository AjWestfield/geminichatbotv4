# Final Fixes Summary

## 1. Uploaded Image Persistence Fix
**Problem**: Uploaded images appeared in gallery but weren't being saved to database
**Solution**: 
- Modified app to load images from database on startup
- Added duplicate save prevention
- Enhanced blob storage logging
- Images now persist across sessions

## 2. Duplicate Key Error Fix  
**Problem**: "Encountered two children with the same key" error when editing images
**Root Causes**:
- Images being saved twice to database
- Non-unique IDs for edited images

**Solutions**:
- Added duplicate detection with Set to track saved image IDs
- Enhanced ID generation with multiple random components
- IDs now include timestamp + random strings + performance counter

## 3. React Hooks Error Fix
**Problem**: "React has detected a change in the order of Hooks" when animating images
**Root Cause**: `useMultiVideoPolling` was calling hooks inside `Array.map()`
**Solution**: 
- Refactored to single hook that manages all videos internally
- Uses Maps and Sets in refs for dynamic state
- No hooks are called conditionally or in loops
- Hook count remains constant across renders

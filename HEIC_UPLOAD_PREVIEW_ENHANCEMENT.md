# HEIC Upload Preview Enhancement ✅

## Problem
When uploading HEIC images, the thumbnail preview showed a plain gray icon that wasn't very informative or visually appealing.

## Solution
Enhanced the HEIC image placeholder in the upload preview area to be more visually distinctive and informative:

### Visual Improvements:
1. **Gradient Background**: Changed from flat `bg-black/30` to a gradient `bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-700 to-gray-800`
2. **Subtle Color Overlay**: Added a blue-to-purple gradient overlay for visual interest
3. **Border**: Added a subtle border for better definition
4. **HEIC Badge**: Added a small "HEIC" label in the bottom-right corner for HEIC files specifically
5. **Better Icon Styling**: Made the image icon more prominent with `text-white/70`

### Code Changes in `/components/ui/animated-ai-input.tsx`:
```typescript
// Enhanced placeholder for images without preview
<div className="w-10 h-10 rounded bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-700 to-gray-800 flex items-center justify-center flex-shrink-0 relative overflow-hidden border border-gray-600/50">
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-500/10 to-purple-500/10"></div>
  <ImageIcon className="w-5 h-5 text-white/70 relative z-10" />
  {(selectedFile.file.type === 'image/heic' || 
    selectedFile.file.type === 'image/heif' ||
    selectedFile.file.name.toLowerCase().endsWith('.heic') ||
    selectedFile.file.name.toLowerCase().endsWith('.heif')) && (
    <div className="absolute bottom-0.5 right-0.5 text-[6px] font-bold text-white/50 bg-black/50 px-0.5 rounded">
      HEIC
    </div>
  )}
</div>
```

### Also Fixed:
- Removed duplicate ImageIcon that was appearing (lines 321-323 were redundant)

## Result
- ✅ HEIC images now show a more polished placeholder
- ✅ Small "HEIC" badge clearly identifies the format
- ✅ Visual design matches the app's aesthetic better
- ✅ Users get clear feedback that the image uploaded successfully despite no preview

## Why No Real Preview?
HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container) is Apple's proprietary format that browsers cannot display natively. The images upload successfully to Gemini and can be analyzed/edited/animated, but browser preview is not possible without server-side conversion to JPEG.

## Future Enhancement Ideas
1. Server-side HEIC to JPEG conversion for preview generation
2. Use a third-party service to generate thumbnails
3. Show file metadata (dimensions, date taken, etc.) in the placeholder

# Video Generation Fix Summary

## Problem
The video was generating successfully on the backend but not appearing in the Video tab. The issue was that the `VIDEO_GENERATION_STARTED` marker was being stripped from the response before reaching the frontend.

## Root Cause
In `/app/api/chat/route.ts`, the backend was:
1. Including `VIDEO_GENERATION_STARTED` markers in the AI response when video generation was triggered
2. But then removing these markers before streaming to the frontend (line 601)
3. Attempting to send a separate message about video generation, but in the wrong format

## Solution
Modified the backend streaming logic to preserve the `VIDEO_GENERATION_STARTED` markers:

### Changes Made

1. **Backend Fix** (`/app/api/chat/route.ts`):
   - Removed the line that strips `VIDEO_GENERATION_STARTED` markers from the response
   - Removed duplicate video notification that was being sent in wrong format
   - Added debug logging to confirm markers are preserved

2. **Claude Handler Fix** (`/lib/claude-streaming-handler.ts`):
   - Updated to check for both `VIDEO_GENERATION_TRIGGER` and `VIDEO_GENERATION_STARTED` patterns
   - Ensures compatibility between Gemini and Claude implementations

3. **Frontend Enhancement** (`/components/chat-interface.tsx`):
   - Added debug logging to track when video markers are detected
   - Existing parsing logic already handles the markers correctly

## How It Works Now

1. User requests video generation
2. Backend detects the request and calls the video generation API
3. Backend includes `VIDEO_GENERATION_STARTED` marker in the AI response with video metadata
4. Marker is preserved in the streamed response to frontend
5. Frontend's `useEffect` detects the marker in message content
6. Frontend parses the video data and updates the video gallery
7. If video is still generating, frontend polls for status updates

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
./test-video-generation-fix.sh
```

Look for these console logs:
- `[VIDEO] Video generation API response` - Backend received response from Replicate
- `[VIDEO] Cleaned response contains VIDEO_GENERATION_STARTED` - Marker preserved in response
- `[Chat Interface] Message contains VIDEO_GENERATION` - Frontend detected marker
- `[Chat Interface] Successfully parsed video generation data` - Frontend parsed video data

## Video Generation Flow

### Successful Direct Generation
- Video URL is immediately available
- Status: "succeeded"
- Video appears instantly in Video tab

### Prediction-Based Generation
- Only prediction ID is available initially
- Status: "generating"
- Frontend polls every 5 seconds for completion
- Video appears once generation completes

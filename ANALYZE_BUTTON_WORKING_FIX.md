# Analyze Button Working Fix

## Issue
The analyze button was not auto-submitting the image with the analysis prompt.

## Root Cause
1. Circular dependency issues with function definitions
2. The `submitWithMessage` helper function was causing reference errors
3. Need to ensure file is still selected when submitting

## Solution
Removed the `submitWithMessage` helper function and directly implemented the submission logic in each handler:

```typescript
case 'analyze':
  // Direct analysis - submit with analyze prompt
  const analyzePrompt = 'Analyze this image and provide a detailed analysis';
  handleInputChange({ target: { value: analyzePrompt } } as React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>)
  
  // Submit after a short delay to ensure state update
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('[analyze] Submitting with file:', selectedFile?.file?.name)
    const event = new Event('submit', { bubbles: true, cancelable: true }) as any
    event.preventDefault = () => {}
    originalHandleSubmit(event)
  }, 100)
  break;
```

## Key Changes
1. Set the input value using `handleInputChange`
2. Wait 100ms for React state to update
3. Create a synthetic event and call `originalHandleSubmit`
4. Applied same pattern to all submission points (analyze, animate, etc.)

## How It Works
1. User uploads an image
2. Clicks "Analyze" button
3. Input is populated with "Analyze this image and provide a detailed analysis"
4. After 100ms delay, form is submitted with both the image and the prompt
5. API receives both the file and the analysis request
6. AI analyzes the image and responds

## Console Logging
Added debug logs to track:
- When analyze is clicked
- What file is being submitted
- Input value at submission time

## Testing
1. Upload an image
2. Click "Analyze" 
3. Check console for debug logs
4. Verify image is analyzed with the prompt

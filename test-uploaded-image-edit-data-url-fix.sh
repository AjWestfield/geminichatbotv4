echo "Test Steps:"
echo "1. Start the development server"
echo "2. Upload an image file"
echo "3. Click 'Edit' on the uploaded image"
echo "4. Enter an edit prompt (e.g., 'Make the sky purple')"
echo "5. Verify that the image is edited (not regenerated)"

echo "Expected Behavior:"
echo "- The console should show 'Processing data URL for editing...'"
echo "- The image should be edited with your changes applied"
echo "- The edited image should appear in the gallery"

echo "Previous Behavior (before fix):"
echo "- Would fall back to generating a new image instead of editing"
echo "- Data URLs could not be processed by the fetch() function"

# Multiple File Upload & Chat Navigation Fixes Complete ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Multiple File Uploads Blocked ✅
**Problem**: After uploading one file, users couldn't upload another file in the same chat session.

**Root Cause**: The file input element wasn't being reset after a file was selected, preventing the `onChange` event from firing for subsequent selections.

**Solution**: 
- Added `e.target.value = ''` after file selection in `animated-ai-input.tsx`
- Added `id="file-upload-input"` for better debugging
- Added `multiple` attribute to enable multi-file selection (foundation for future enhancement)

### 2. Clear Chat History Button ✅
**Problem**: No way to clear all chat history at once from the sidebar.

**Solution**: Added a "Clear Chat History" button in `app-sidebar.tsx`:
- Shows only when there are chats and sidebar is expanded
- Confirms before deletion with browser confirm dialog
- Deletes all chats and starts a new chat
- Styled with red color to indicate destructive action

### 3. Chat Navigation Not Working ✅
**Problem**: Clicking on a chat in the sidebar didn't load that chat session.

**Root Cause**: The `handleChatSelect` function wasn't setting the current chat ID, so the UI didn't know which chat to display.

**Solution**: 
- Added `setCurrentChatId(chatId)` in the `handleChatSelect` function
- Also added loading of videos from the selected chat
- Chat interface properly receives the loaded messages and chat ID

## Code Changes

### 1. `/components/ui/animated-ai-input.tsx`
```typescript
// Reset input after file selection
onChange={(e) => {
  const files = e.target.files
  if (files && files.length > 0 && onFileSelect) {
    onFileSelect(files[0])
    // Reset the input so files can be selected again
    e.target.value = ''
  }
}}
```

### 2. `/components/app-sidebar.tsx`
```typescript
// Added Clear Chat History button
{!isCollapsed && chats.length > 0 && (
  <div className="mb-4 px-2">
    <Button
      onClick={async () => {
        if (confirm('Are you sure you want to clear all chat history? This cannot be undone.')) {
          for (const chat of chats) {
            await deleteChat(chat.id)
          }
          onNewChat?.()
        }
      }}
      className="w-full justify-start gap-2 text-red-600 hover:text-red-700 hover:bg-red-50"
      variant="ghost"
      size="sm"
    >
      <Trash2 className="h-4 w-4" />
      Clear Chat History
    </Button>
  </div>
)}
```

### 3. `/app/page.tsx`
```typescript
// Fixed chat selection
const handleChatSelect = useCallback(async (chatId: string) => {
  setChatLoading(true)
  // Set the current chat ID to switch to the selected chat
  setCurrentChatId(chatId)
  
  const chatData = await loadChat(chatId)
  if (chatData) {
    // ... load messages, images, and videos
  }
  setChatLoading(false)
}, [loadChat, selectedModel, setCurrentChatId])
```

## Future Enhancements

### Multiple File Selection at Once
The foundation is laid with `multiple` attribute, but needs:
1. Update UI to show multiple file previews
2. Handle array of files in `handleFileSelect`
3. Process files sequentially or in parallel
4. Update attachment display for multiple files

### Bulk Operations
- Select multiple chats to delete
- Export/import chat history
- Archive old chats

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Sequential uploads** now work smoothly without page refresh
2. **Chat history** is easily manageable with clear all option
3. **Chat navigation** provides seamless switching between conversations
4. **File input** properly resets for better reliability

The app now handles file uploads and chat management much more intuitively!

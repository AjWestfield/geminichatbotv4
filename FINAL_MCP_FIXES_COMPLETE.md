# Final MCP Fixes Complete

## All Issues Fixed

### 1. API Key Issue ✅
**Problem**: AI-powered JSON correction was failing with "Google Generative AI API key is missing" because it expected `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` but the environment uses `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

**Solution**: Updated all `google()` model calls to explicitly pass the API key:
```typescript
// Before:
model: google('gemini-2.0-flash-exp')

// After:
model: google('gemini-2.0-flash-exp', {
  apiKey: process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY
})
```

### 2. Incomplete JSON Detection ✅
**Problem**: The incomplete JSON pattern from the user wasn't being detected properly:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
```

**Solution**: Enhanced pattern detection with:
- Better regex patterns for mcpServers format
- Detection of partial args arrays
- Context-aware server name extraction
- Auto-completion for known servers like sequential-thinking

### 3. Missing Tool Calls ✅
**Problem**: When analyzing GitHub URLs, the AI said it was searching but didn't generate actual [TOOL_CALL] blocks.

**Solution**: Fixed in previous commits by:
- Dynamic tool discovery instead of hardcoded servers
- Proper tool/server name resolution
- Clear system prompts for tool usage

## How It Works Now

### Intelligent JSON Correction
When you paste incomplete JSON like:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
```

The system will:
1. Detect the parse error
2. Extract "sequential-thinking" from the partial JSON
3. Look up the known server configuration
4. Return the complete, valid configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "sequential-thinking",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"],
  "transportType": "stdio",
  "description": "Sequential thinking and reasoning server"
}
```

### GitHub URL Analysis
When you provide a GitHub URL:
1. Extracts owner, repo, and path from the URL
2. Searches for available search tools (Context7, Exa)
3. Generates proper [TOOL_CALL] with correct server names
4. Analyzes repository to extract MCP configuration
5. Auto-adds the server to your system

## Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
chmod +x test-final-mcp-fixes.sh
./test-final-mcp-fixes.sh
```

Or test manually:
1. Start the app: `npm run dev`
2. Go to Settings → MCP Servers
3. Paste the incomplete JSON and click "Import & Connect"
4. It should auto-complete and add the server successfully

## Files Modified
- `/lib/mcp/mcp-server-intelligence.ts` - Fixed API key usage and pattern detection
- `/app/api/chat/route.ts` - Fixed hardcoded server references
- Added sequential-thinking to known servers list

## Result
The intelligent MCP server detection now:
- ✅ Handles incomplete JSON gracefully
- ✅ Uses the correct API key (GEMINI_API_KEY)
- ✅ Auto-completes known server configurations
- ✅ Provides helpful error messages
- ✅ Works with GitHub URL analysis

Users can now paste partial configurations and the system will intelligently complete them!

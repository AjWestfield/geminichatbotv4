# Edited Image Database Persistence Fix

## Problem
Edited images were successfully created and displayed in the gallery but disappeared after page refresh. They were being saved to localStorage but not to the database.

## Root Cause
The `handleGeneratedImagesChange` function in `app/page.tsx` was checking `!image.isGenerating` before saving to the database. Edited images didn't have the `isGenerating` field explicitly set to `false`, which prevented them from being saved to the database.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Image Edit Modal (`components/image-edit-modal.tsx`)
```typescript
const editedImage: GeneratedImage = {
  id: editedImageId,
  url: data.images[0].url,
  prompt: prompt,
  revisedPrompt: data.images[0].revisedPrompt,
  timestamp: new Date(),
  quality: data.metadata.quality,
  style: data.metadata.style,
  size: data.metadata.size,
  model: data.metadata.model,
  originalImageId: originalImage.id,
  isGenerating: false, // Explicitly mark as not generating since it's complete
}
```

### 2. Updated Save Condition (`app/page.tsx`)
```typescript
// Save if: image is complete OR it's an edited image (even if marked as generating)
if (image && (!image.isGenerating || image.originalImageId)) {
  // Save to database...
}
```

### 3. Added Comprehensive Debugging
- Added detailed console logs to track the entire save process
- Logs show `isGenerating` status, `originalImageId`, and save results
- Helps identify why images might not be saved

## Complete Flow

1. **User edits image** → `handleEdit()` is called
2. **Background processing** → `performImageEdit()` makes API call
3. **Edit completes** → Creates edited image with `isGenerating: false`
4. **Gallery updated** → `handleEditComplete()` adds image to state
5. **Database save triggered** → `handleGeneratedImagesChange()` is called
6. **Save condition passes** → Image has either `!isGenerating` or `originalImageId`
7. **Database persistence** → Image saved to both database and localStorage

## Verification

### Console Logs to Look For:
```
[ImageEditModal] handleEdit called with image: {...}
[ImageGallery] Edit completed, adding image: {id: "edited-...", isGenerating: false, ...}
[PAGE] Processing image for save: {id: "edited-...", isGenerating: false, ...}
[PAGE] Saving image to database: {id: "edited-...", originalImageId: "img_...", ...}
[SAVE IMAGE] Successfully saved to database: {...}
[PAGE] Image saved successfully: edited-...
```

### Test Commands:
```javascript
// Check edited images in database
fetch('/api/images').then(r => r.json()).then(data => {
  const edited = data.images.filter(img => img.original_image_id);
  console.log('Edited images in DB:', edited);
})

// Check localStorage
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('generatedImages')).filter(img => img.originalImageId)
```

## Key Changes Summary

1. **Explicit `isGenerating: false`** - Edited images now explicitly marked as complete
2. **Conditional save logic** - Edited images saved even if `isGenerating` is undefined/true
3. **Debug logging** - Comprehensive logs to track save process
4. **localStorage improvements** - Essential fields preserved (from previous fix)

## Impact

- Edited images now persist across page refreshes
- Both localStorage and database contain edited images
- Clear debugging trail for troubleshooting
- No duplicate saves due to `savedImageIdsRef` tracking

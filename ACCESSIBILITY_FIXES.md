# Accessibility and Best Practice Fixes

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ✅ SVG Accessibility - Added Title Element

**File**: `components/image-gallery.tsx`  
**Line**: 197-198

**Issue**: SVG element was missing a title for screen readers

**Fix**: Added descriptive title element
```xml
<svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <title>Image being generated</title>
  <!-- paths... -->
</svg>
```

**Impact**: 
- Screen readers can now announce "Image being generated" when encountering this icon
- Improves accessibility for users with visual impairments
- Complies with WCAG accessibility guidelines

### 2. ✅ JavaScript Best Practice - Number Constants

**File**: `components/ui/ai-chat-image-generation-1.tsx`  
**Line**: 61

**Issue**: Using global `Infinity` instead of namespace

**Fix**: Changed to use Number namespace
```typescript
// Before
repeat: loadingState === "completed" ? 0 : Infinity,

// After  
repeat: loadingState === "completed" ? 0 : Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY,
```

**Impact**:
- Follows JavaScript best practices
- More explicit and clear about the value being used
- Prevents potential issues with global scope pollution
- Better for code maintainability

## Verification

Both fixes have been tested and verified:
- ✅ SVG now has proper accessibility title
- ✅ Animation still works correctly with Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY
- ✅ No functionality changes, only code quality improvements

## Benefits

1. **Better Accessibility**: Users with screen readers get context about the generating image placeholder
2. **Code Quality**: Following JavaScript best practices for numeric constants
3. **Maintainability**: Code is more explicit and follows modern standards
4. **No Breaking Changes**: Both fixes are purely improvements with no functional impact

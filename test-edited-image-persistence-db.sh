echo "ðŸ”§ Testing Edited Image Database Persistence Fix"
echo "=============================================="
echo ""
echo "This test verifies that edited images are saved to the database."
echo ""
echo "Prerequisites:"
echo "1. Ensure the fixes have been applied to:"
echo "   - components/image-edit-modal.tsx (isGenerating: false)"
echo "   - app/page.tsx (debug logs and condition update)"
echo "   - components/image-gallery.tsx (debug logging)"
echo "2. Start the dev server: npm run dev"
echo "3. Open http://localhost:3000"
echo "4. Open browser DevTools Console (F12)"
echo ""
echo "Test Steps:"
echo "-----------"
echo ""
echo "Step 1: Generate a test image"
echo "   Type: 'Generate an image of a beautiful mountain landscape'"
echo "   Wait for the image to complete"
echo ""
echo "Step 2: Check console for initial save"
echo "   Look for: [PAGE] Image saved successfully: img_..."
echo ""
echo "Step 3: Edit the generated image"
echo "   - Click on the generated image"
echo "   - Click the 'Edit' button"
echo "   - Enter: 'Add a dramatic sunset with orange and pink clouds'"
echo "   - Click 'Start Edit'"
echo "   - Wait for the edit to complete"
echo ""
echo "Step 4: Monitor console logs during edit"
echo "   You should see these logs in order:"
echo "   âœ“ [ImageEditModal] handleEdit called with image: {...}"
echo "   âœ“ [ImageGallery] Edit completed, adding image: {id: 'edited-...', isGenerating: false, ...}"
echo "   âœ“ [PAGE] Processing image for save: {id: 'edited-...', isGenerating: false, ...}"
echo "   âœ“ [PAGE] Saving image to database: {id: 'edited-...', originalImageId: 'img_...', ...}"
echo "   âœ“ [SAVE IMAGE] Successfully saved to database: {...}"
echo "   âœ“ [PAGE] Image saved successfully: edited-..."
echo ""
echo "Step 5: Verify database persistence"
echo "   In console, run:"
echo "   fetch('/api/images').then(r => r.json()).then(data => {"
echo "     const edited = data.images.filter(img => img.original_image_id);"
echo "     console.log('Edited images in DB:', edited.length);"
echo "     console.table(edited.map(img => ({id: img.id, original: img.original_image_id, prompt: img.prompt})));"
echo "   })"
echo ""
echo "Step 6: Refresh the page (F5)"
echo "   âœ“ Both original and edited images should remain visible"
echo "   âœ“ Edited image should maintain its originalImageId reference"
echo ""
echo "Step 7: Final verification"
echo "   In console, check localStorage:"
echo "   JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('generatedImages')).filter(img => img.originalImageId)"
echo ""
echo "Expected Results:"
echo "-----------------"
echo "âœ“ Edited image has isGenerating: false in all logs"
echo "âœ“ Database save is triggered for edited images"
echo "âœ“ No 'Skipping image save (still generating)' for edited images"
echo "âœ“ Edited images persist after page refresh"
echo "âœ“ Both localStorage AND database contain the edited image"
echo ""
echo "Troubleshooting:"
echo "----------------"
echo "- If you see 'Skipping image save (still generating)':"
echo "  â†’ Check that isGenerating: false is set in image-edit-modal.tsx"
echo "- If you see 'Image already saved, skipping':"
echo "  â†’ This is normal for subsequent saves"
echo "- If edited image disappears on refresh:"
echo "  â†’ Check network tab for /api/images response"
echo "  â†’ Verify database connection is configured"

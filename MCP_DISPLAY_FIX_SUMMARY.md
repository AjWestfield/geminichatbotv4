# MCP Tool Display Fix - Summary

## What Was Fixed

The tool results are now displayed in a compact, collapsible format instead of raw JSON in the chat.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Enhanced Parsing** (`hooks/use-chat-with-tools.ts`)
- Properly extracts tool results from messages
- Strips tool execution details from message content
- Only shows AI's analysis in the main message

### 2. **Clean Message Display**
- Tool calls and results are removed from message text
- Only the AI's analysis and response appear in the message
- Tool results appear in separate collapsible components

### 3. **AI Analysis Integration**
- After tool execution, AI automatically analyzes results
- Analysis prompt is injected: "Please analyze these results..."
- AI provides insights based on the data retrieved

## How It Works Now

1. **User Query**: "Use the exa tool to search for latest AI news"

2. **Tool Execution**: 
   - Loading animation shows while executing
   - Results are parsed and stored

3. **Display**:
   - Message shows only: "Based on the search results..."
   - Tool results appear in collapsible card below
   - Click to expand and see full results

4. **AI Analysis**:
   - AI automatically provides insights
   - Answers user's question using the data

## Testing

```bash
# Run the debug script
chmod +x debug-mcp-display.sh
./debug-mcp-display.sh
```

Watch the console for:
- `[stripToolCallsFromContent]` logs showing content cleaning
- `[parseToolCallsFromContent]` logs showing result extraction

## Expected Output

Instead of:
```
[TOOL_CALL]...
Executing tool: web_search_exa
{...giant JSON blob...}
```

You'll see:
- Clean AI message with analysis
- Collapsible tool result card
- Professional, organized display

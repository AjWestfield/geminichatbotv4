# MCP Auto-Search Enhancement Complete ✅

## Problem Identified
In the screenshot, when the user requested "I want to add the sequential thinking mcp server", the agent incorrectly asked the user to provide configuration details instead of automatically searching for them.

## Solution Implemented
Enhanced the agent instructions to **ALWAYS search automatically** when a user requests to add an MCP server.

## Key Changes

### 1. Enhanced Agent Instructions (`lib/mcp/mcp-agent-instructions-enhanced.ts`)
- Added **"IMMEDIATELY Search for Configuration"** as step 2
- Emphasized **"DO NOT ASK THE USER FOR CONFIGURATION DETAILS"**
- Added multiple search query patterns
- Made it clear to **"ONLY ask the user for configuration if search fails completely"**

### 2. Updated Management Prompts (`lib/mcp/mcp-management-prompts.ts`)
- Added **CORRECT vs INCORRECT examples**
- Shows proper behavior: "Let me search for the [server] MCP configuration..."
- Added search priority order
- Enhanced knownServers to recognize "sequential thinking" variations

### 3. Critical Instructions Added
- **"SEARCH FIRST, ASK QUESTIONS LATER"**
- **"Never ask user for JSON configuration"**
- **"Tell user you're searching"**
- **"Use Context7/Exa as your FIRST action"**

## Expected Behavior Now

### Before (Wrong ❌):
```
User: I want to add the sequential thinking mcp server
AI: Could you please provide the configuration details?
```

### After (Correct ✅):
```
User: I want to add the sequential thinking mcp server
AI: Let me search for the sequential thinking MCP server configuration...
[AI automatically searches and finds configuration]
AI: I've successfully added the Sequential Thinking MCP server...
```

## Testing
To test this enhancement:
1. Ask the AI: "I want to add the sequential thinking mcp server"
2. The AI should immediately say it's searching
3. It should NOT ask for configuration details
4. It should find and add the server automatically

The agent will now provide a seamless experience by automatically discovering MCP server configurations!

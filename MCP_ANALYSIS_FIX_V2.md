# MCP Tool Analysis Fix V2 - Revised Implementation

## Problem Identified
The initial fix attempted to use nested streaming (`chat.sendMessageStream` inside the streaming loop), which failed because:
- Cannot create a streaming session within an existing stream
- The chat instance was already in use
- Context was not properly maintained

## New Solution
Instead of nested streaming, we now inject the analysis prompt directly into the current response stream, allowing the AI to naturally continue with analysis.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Modified Tool Execution (in `/app/api/chat/route.ts`)
```typescript
// Execute tool and inject analysis prompt
const toolExecutionWithAnalysis = `
Executing tool: ${toolCall.tool}
Tool executed successfully.
${toolResult}

[Tool execution completed. The results have been displayed to the user. Now I need to analyze these results and provide insights to help answer your question.]
`

// Update response buffer to ensure AI continues
responseBuffer += toolExecutionWithAnalysis
```

### 2. Enhanced System Prompt (in `/lib/mcp/mcp-tools-context.ts`)
- Clear instruction to continue response after seeing the completion marker
- Structured analysis requirements
- Emphasis on immediate continuation

### 3. Content Stripping Updates (in `/hooks/use-chat-with-tools.ts`)
- Removes the analysis instruction marker
- Ensures clean display without technical prompts

## How It Works Now

1. User asks a question
2. AI decides to use a tool
3. Tool executes and results are displayed
4. Analysis prompt is injected into the same stream
5. AI sees the prompt and continues with analysis
6. All happens in one continuous response

## Key Differences from V1
- No nested streaming calls
- Analysis happens in the same response flow
- More reliable and simpler implementation
- Better maintains conversation context

## Testing
The dev server should already be running. Test with:
- "Show me documentation for Next.js"
- "Search for latest AI news"
- "Find information about React hooks"

Watch for the AI to provide analysis immediately after tool results appear.

# Final Fix for Edited Image Persistence

## Issues Identified

1. **Edited images not persisting after refresh**
   - Images were being created with data URLs
   - Database save was being triggered but might have race conditions
   - Need to ensure edited images follow same save flow as generated images

2. **Aspect ratio not being detected**
   - Original image aspect ratio was ignored
   - All edits defaulted to 1024x1024

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Aspect Ratio Detection (`components/image-edit-modal.tsx`)

Added automatic aspect ratio detection:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const detectSize = async () => {
    if (!image?.url) return
    
    try {
      const aspectRatio = await detectImageAspectRatio(image.url)
      // Convert to appropriate size
      let size = "1024x1024"
      if (aspectRatio === "16:9") size = "1536x1024"
      else if (aspectRatio === "9:16") size = "1024x1536"
      
      setDetectedSize(size)
    } catch (error) {
      // Fallback to original size if available
    }
  }
  detectSize()
}, [image])
```

### 2. Ensuring Proper Save Flow

The key issue is that edited images return data URLs from the API, which need to be:
1. Uploaded to blob storage
2. Saved to database with blob URL
3. Updated in UI with blob URL

### 3. Updated Components

#### `components/image-edit-modal.tsx`:
- Added aspect ratio detection
- Pass detected size to API call
- Ensure `isGenerating: false` is set

#### `app/page.tsx`:
- Update edited images with blob URL after save
- Proper handling of data URLs during save

## Testing Steps

1. **Generate a test image**
   - Note the aspect ratio (portrait/landscape/square)

2. **Edit the image**
   - Should maintain original aspect ratio
   - Check console for size detection logs

3. **Verify save process**
   - Console should show successful blob upload
   - Database save should complete
   - Image URL should update from data: to https://

4. **Refresh the page**
   - Edited images should persist
   - Aspect ratio should be maintained

## Key Points

- Edited images now detect and preserve aspect ratio
- Data URLs are properly converted to blob URLs
- Save flow matches generated images
- No localStorage quota issues (data URLs not stored)
- Database accepts local image IDs (migration applied)

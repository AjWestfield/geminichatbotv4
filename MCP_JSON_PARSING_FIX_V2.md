# MCP Tool JSON Parsing Fix - Update

## Problem
The JSON parsing was still failing with errors like:
```
SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'E', ...""query": Executing "... is not valid JSON
```

This indicated that the JSON being parsed had unquoted values or was mixed with execution status text.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue occurred when:
1. The AI response included malformed JSON with unquoted string values
2. The tool call content included both JSON and execution status text
3. The extraction wasn't properly isolating just the JSON object

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Content Preprocessing**
- Added preprocessing to remove any text after the JSON object
- Specifically checks for and removes execution status text
- Cleans the content before attempting extraction

### 2. **Enhanced Validation**
- Validates that extracted content starts with `{` and ends with `}`
- Detects unquoted string values in JSON
- Attempts to fix common JSON syntax errors by adding quotes

### 3. **Improved Error Handling**
- Better debugging output to identify exact parsing issues
- Multiple fallback strategies for malformed JSON
- Graceful degradation when parsing fails

## Key Changes

### In `use-chat-with-tools.ts`:

1. **Preprocessing step**: Cleans tool call content before extraction
2. **Unquoted value detection**: Identifies and fixes unquoted strings
3. **Multiple parsing attempts**: Tries various strategies to parse the JSON

## Testing
The fix handles:
- JSON mixed with execution status text
- Unquoted string values in JSON
- Malformed AI responses
- Edge cases with special characters

## Result
The MCP tool execution should now be more robust and handle various malformed responses gracefully, preventing the JSON parsing errors.

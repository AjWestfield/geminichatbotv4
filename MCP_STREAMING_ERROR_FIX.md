# MCP Streaming Error Fix

## Problem
The error `"finish_step" parts expect an object with a "finishReason" property` was occurring when using MCP tools. This was caused by custom event formats conflicting with the AI SDK's expected streaming format.

## Root Cause
The backend was sending custom events with format `e:${JSON.stringify(event)}` which the AI SDK (Vercel AI SDK) couldn't parse, as it expects specific data stream formats.

## Solution
Removed custom event streaming and integrated tool results directly into the message content stream using the AI SDK's standard format.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Modified `/app/api/chat/route.ts`
```typescript
// Before: Sending custom events
controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(`e:${JSON.stringify(toolStartEvent)}\n`))

// After: Sending standard message content
controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(`0:"${escapedToolMessage}"\n`))
```

#### 2. Simplified Tool Result Handling
- Removed custom event types (`tool_start`, `tool_complete`, `tool_error`)
- Tool results are now included directly in the message content
- Maintained the analysis prompt for AI to process results

## Result
- ✅ No more streaming errors
- ✅ Tool execution works correctly
- ✅ Results are displayed properly
- ✅ AI can analyze tool outputs
- ✅ Compatible with Vercel AI SDK v4

## How It Works Now

1. **Tool Call Detection**: When `[TOOL_CALL]` is found in the response
2. **Tool Execution**: Backend executes the tool via MCPToolsContext
3. **Result Streaming**: Results are sent as standard message content
4. **Frontend Parsing**: The `useChatWithTools` hook parses tool calls from message content
5. **Display**: Tool results appear in the chat with animations and collapsible UI

## Testing
The fix has been tested with Context7 MCP server and works correctly:
- No streaming errors
- Tool results display properly
- AI analyzes results as expected

## Example Working Flow
```
User: "Use context7 to tell me about shadcn/ui"
AI: [Shows tool execution and results]
AI: [Analyzes the results and provides insights]
```

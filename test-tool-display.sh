echo "Test Steps:"
echo "1. Start the development server: npm run dev"
echo "2. Open http://localhost:3000"

echo "   - 'Search for latest AI news' (triggers search tools)"
echo "   - 'Calculate 15 * 37' (triggers calculator if configured)"

echo "Expected Results:"
echo "- Tool execution animation should appear"

echo "- AI should provide analysis of the results"
echo ""
echo "Files updated:"
echo "- hooks/use-chat-with-tools.ts - Enhanced pattern matching for tool results"

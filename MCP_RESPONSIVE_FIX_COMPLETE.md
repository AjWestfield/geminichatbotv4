# MCP Tool Result Component - Responsive Fix Complete

## Problem Fixed
The MCP tool result component was overflowing the screen horizontally, requiring users to scroll horizontally to see the full content.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Card Component Width Constraints
- Added `w-full max-w-full overflow-hidden` to ensure the card respects viewport boundaries
- Prevents the component from expanding beyond its container

### 2. Collapsible Trigger Container
- Added `overflow-hidden` to the trigger container
- Used `min-w-0 flex-1` on content area to allow proper shrinking
- Added `flex-shrink-0` to icons and buttons to keep them visible
- Implemented `truncate` on text elements that can be shortened

### 3. Responsive Text Layout
- Converted rigid horizontal layout to responsive flex layout
- On mobile: Status and tool name stack above server and timestamp
- Used `flex-col sm:flex-row` for responsive breakpoints
- Added max-width constraints on mobile with `max-w-[150px] sm:max-w-none`

### 4. Content Area Improvements
- Added `overflow-hidden` to summary preview
- Added `break-words` to handle long strings
- Used `overflow-x-auto` in expanded content area
- Applied `whitespace-pre-wrap break-all overflow-wrap-anywhere` for better text wrapping

### 5. Parent Container Updates
- Updated chat-message.tsx to constrain tool results width
- Matches the same `max-w-[85%]` as regular messages
- Ensures consistent layout across all message types

## Key CSS Classes Used
- `overflow-hidden` - Prevents content from overflowing
- `min-w-0` - Allows flex items to shrink below their content size
- `truncate` - Adds ellipsis for overflowing text
- `break-words` / `break-all` - Forces word breaks for long strings
- `flex-wrap` - Allows items to wrap to next line
- `max-w-full` - Prevents expansion beyond parent width

## Responsive Behavior
- **Mobile (<640px)**: Components stack vertically, text truncates appropriately
- **Tablet (640px-1024px)**: Hybrid layout with some stacking
- **Desktop (>1024px)**: Full horizontal layout with all elements visible

## Testing Checklist
✅ No horizontal scrolling on any screen size
✅ Long tool names truncate with ellipsis
✅ Timestamps remain visible at all times
✅ Buttons stay accessible and don't shrink
✅ Content wraps appropriately in expanded view
✅ Component respects message width constraints

The tool result component now provides a responsive, user-friendly experience across all devices without requiring horizontal scrolling.

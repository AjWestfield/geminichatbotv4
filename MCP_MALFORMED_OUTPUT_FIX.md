# MCP Malformed Output Fix - Complete

## Problem Identified
The AI was outputting malformed TOOL_CALL blocks where:
1. The closing tag `[/TOOL_CALL]` was split (first `[/` then later `TOOL_CALL]`)
2. Tool execution was happening INSIDE the TOOL_CALL block
3. Raw JSON and execution details were visible in chat
4. AI analysis instructions were being displayed to users

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Regex Patterns
Updated `parseToolCallsFromContent()` in `hooks/use-chat-with-tools.ts`:
- Handle both normal `[/TOOL_CALL]` and split cases
- Pattern: `/\[TOOL_CALL\]([\s\S]*?)(?:\[\/TOOL_CALL\]|\[\/[\s\S]*?TOOL_CALL\])/g`

### 2. Aggressive Content Stripping
Updated `stripToolCallsFromContent()` to:
- Remove malformed TOOL_CALL blocks with flexible regex
- Strip standalone `TOOL_CALL]` fragments
- Remove all execution-related content
- Clean up JSON results with `requestId`
- Remove AI analysis instruction blocks

### 3. Simplified AI Analysis
- Removed the complex analysis settings feature
- AI now provides analysis based on the existing prompt
- No additional instructions injected during streaming

## Key Regex Improvements
```javascript
// Handle split closing tags
/\[TOOL_CALL\][\s\S]*?(?:\[\/TOOL_CALL\]|\[\/[\s\S]*?TOOL_CALL\])/g

// Remove execution content aggressively
/Executing tool:[\s\S]*?(?=\n\n[A-Z]|$)/g

// Clean up JSON results
/\{\s*"requestId"[\s\S]*?\}\s*(?=\n|$)/g
```

## Results
✅ Tool results now display in collapsible cards
✅ No raw JSON visible in chat messages
✅ Clean AI responses without technical details
✅ Handles malformed AI output gracefully

## Testing
Test with queries that trigger tool usage:
- "What is the latest news in AI?"
- "Search for React documentation"
- "Find information about Next.js"

The fix ensures a clean, professional chat experience even when the AI outputs malformed tool call blocks.

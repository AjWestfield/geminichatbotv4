echo "✅ Fixed JSX Syntax Errors!"
echo "=========================="
echo ""
echo "🔧 What Was Wrong:"
echo "- Unclosed ScrollArea tag at line 672"
echo "- Extra closing </div> tags that didn't match any opening tags"
echo "- This caused a cascade of parsing errors throughout the file"
echo ""
echo "🛠️ What I Fixed:"
echo "- Removed duplicate closing tags after isGeneratingImage block"
echo "- Properly closed the ScrollArea component"
echo "- Fixed the JSX structure"
echo ""
echo "📋 The structure is now:"
echo "  <ScrollArea>"
echo "    <div> // flex container"
echo "      {messages...}"
echo "      {isLoading...}"
echo "      {isGeneratingImage...}"
echo "    </div>"
echo "  </ScrollArea>"
echo ""
echo "✨ Result:"
echo "- All syntax errors should be resolved"
echo "- The file should compile correctly"
echo "- VS Code errors should disappear"
echo ""
echo "If you still see errors in VS Code:"
echo "1. Save the file (Cmd+S)"
echo "2. Restart TypeScript server (Cmd+Shift+P → 'TypeScript: Restart TS Server')"
echo ""
echo "The syntax is now clean! 🎯"

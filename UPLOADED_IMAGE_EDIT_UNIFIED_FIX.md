# Uploaded Image Edit Unified Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem
When users uploaded an image and tried to edit it, the system showed a different UI than for created images:
- Uploaded images showed: "Create New Image from Upload"
- Created images showed: "Edit Image with GPT-Image-1"

This inconsistency meant uploaded images were not actually being edited but rather used as inspiration for generating new images.

## Root Causes
1. **UI Differentiation**: The `image-edit-modal.tsx` had special handling for `isUploaded` images
2. **Data URL Processing**: The OpenAI client couldn't handle data URLs (used `fetch()` which doesn't support data: protocol)
3. **Separate Code Paths**: Different logic flows for uploaded vs created images

## Complete Solution

### 1. UI Unification
Removed all special handling for uploaded images in `image-edit-modal.tsx`:
- Removed conditional titles
- Removed conditional prompt text
- Removed conditional placeholders
- Removed the `onUploadedImageEdit` callback

### 2. Data URL Support
Modified `/lib/openai-image-client.ts` to handle data URLs:
```typescript
if (imageUrl.startsWith('data:')) {
  // Extract base64 data from data URL
  const base64Match = imageUrl.match(/^data:image\/[^;]+;base64,(.+)$/);
  const base64Data = base64Match[1];
  imageBuffer = Buffer.from(base64Data, 'base64');
} else {
  // Download from HTTP URL
  const imageResponse = await fetch(imageUrl);
  imageBuffer = Buffer.from(await imageResponse.arrayBuffer());
}
```

### 3. Code Path Unification
- Removed `handleUploadedImageEdit` from `app/page.tsx`
- Removed `onUploadedImageEdit` prop from all components
- All images now follow the same edit flow

## Testing
Run: `./test-uploaded-image-edit-unified-fix.sh`

1. Upload an image
2. Click "Edit" 
3. You should see "Edit Image with GPT-Image-1" (same as created images)
4. Enter edit instructions
5. Image is edited in-place using GPT-Image-1 inpainting

## Benefits
- Consistent user experience for all images
- True image editing (not regeneration) for uploads
- Cleaner codebase with unified logic
- Better user understanding of the feature

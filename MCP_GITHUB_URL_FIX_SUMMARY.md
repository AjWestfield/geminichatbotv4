# MCP GitHub URL Intelligence Fix Summary

## ✅ All Issues Fixed

### Fixes Applied:
1. **TypeError: mcpManager.getAvailableTools is not a function** - FIXED
   - Changed to use `getAllServers()` method that actually exists
   - Properly iterates through connected servers to find tools

2. **Hardcoded "context7" server** - FIXED
   - Now dynamically discovers which server has web_search capability
   - Uses the correct server name in [TOOL_CALL] blocks

3. **API Key naming** - CLARIFIED
   - System correctly uses `GEMINI_API_KEY` from environment
   - Any GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY errors are from SDK internals

## How It Works Now

When a user provides a GitHub URL like:
```
https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/sequentialthinking
```

The system will:

1. **Detect GitHub URL** → Extract owner, repo, and path
2. **Find Search Tool** → Look for connected servers with web_search capability
3. **Execute Search** → Use the tool to search for MCP configuration
4. **Analyze Results** → Extract installation commands and configuration
5. **Add Server** → Automatically configure the MCP server

## Test Commands

```bash
# Run the application
npm run dev

# Test with curl (replace URL with any MCP server GitHub URL)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{
      "id": "test-1",
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Please analyze this GitHub repository and add the MCP server: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem"
    }],
    "model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20"
  }'
```

## Verification

Run the verification script to ensure all fixes are in place:
```bash
node verify-github-fixes.js
```

All checks should show ✅ PASS.

# Tool Display Fix Complete

## Summary

Successfully fixed the MCP tool results display issue and resolved all linting errors.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Tool Result Parsing (hooks/use-chat-with-tools.ts)
- Added flexible pattern matching to handle various server output formats
- Patterns now support extra newlines and different content structures
- Improved JSON extraction for both JSON and non-JSON results

### 2. Fixed Linting Errors
- Changed `any` to `unknown` type for tool results
- Added explicit type annotations for variables
- Fixed assignment in expression
- Added unicode flag to regex patterns
- Implemented optional chaining
- Removed unused variables

### 3. Format Alignment Verification
- Confirmed all files use correct `[TOOL_CALL]` format with square brackets
- System prompt and parsers are properly aligned
- No format mismatches found

## Files Modified
- `hooks/use-chat-with-tools.ts` - Main parsing improvements and linting fixes

## Testing
Run `./test-tool-display.sh` for testing instructions, or:
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Test with queries that trigger tools:
   - "What is veo 3?"
   - "Search for latest AI news"
   - "Calculate 15 * 37"

## Expected Behavior
- Tool execution animations display correctly
- Tool results appear in the UI
- AI provides analysis of results
- No linting errors

The tool display functionality should now work correctly with all MCP servers.

- Modified `app-sidebar.tsx` to show real chat history
- Added chat grouping by time periods (Today, Yesterday, This Week, etc.)
- Implemented search, edit, and delete functionality
- Connected all components with the persistence system

### 3. **Key Features Added**

- ✅ Real-time chat history updates
- ✅ Message persistence with attachments
- ✅ Image gallery persistence
- ✅ Chat search functionality
- ✅ Chat rename capability
- ✅ Chat deletion with confirmation
- ✅ Load previous chats with full history
- ✅ Model selection persistence

### 4. **Setup Automation**
- Created `setup-persistence.js` script for easy configuration
- Added `npm run setup-persistence` command
- Comprehensive setup validation and testing
- Clear error messages and guidance

### 5. **Documentation**
- Created detailed `PERSISTENCE_GUIDE.md`
- Documented all API endpoints
- Provided troubleshooting steps
- Included privacy and performance tips

## How to Use

### Quick Start
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install @supabase/supabase-js @vercel/blob date-fns
   ```

2. Configure environment variables in `.env.local`:
   ```env
   SUPABASE_URL=your-url
   SUPABASE_API_KEY=your-key
   BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your-token
   ```

3. Run setup:
   ```bash
   npm run setup-persistence
   ```

4. Create database tables (if needed) using the SQL in `lib/database/schema.sql`

5. Start using the app - chats will automatically persist!

## What Works Now

### In the Sidebar
- **New Chat** button creates fresh conversations
- **Chat History** shows all previous chats
- **Search** finds chats by content
- **Edit** icon lets you rename chats
- **Delete** icon removes chats

### In the Chat Interface
- Messages are automatically saved
- Images are persisted to cloud storage
- File attachments are preserved
- Model selection is remembered

### When Loading Chats
- Click any chat in sidebar to load it
- All messages are restored
- Images are loaded from cloud
- You can continue the conversation

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
```sql
- chats: Stores chat metadata
- messages: Stores all messages with attachments
- images: Stores generated image references
```

### API Endpoints
```
/api/chats - Chat CRUD operations
/api/chats/[id]/messages - Message operations
/api/images - Image persistence
```

### Storage
- **Supabase**: Relational data (chats, messages)
- **Vercel Blob**: Image file storage
- **Redis**: Optional caching layer

## Next Steps (Optional)

Future enhancements could include:
- Export chats as markdown/PDF
- Share chats with unique URLs
- Bulk operations (delete multiple)
- Chat templates
- Automatic backups

## Summary

The chat persistence system is now fully implemented and ready to use. Users can:
1. Have all their conversations automatically saved
2. Return to previous chats anytime
3. Search through their chat history
4. Manage their chats (rename, delete)
5. Keep their generated images safe in the cloud

The implementation handles all edge cases, provides proper error handling, and includes comprehensive setup automation to make configuration as easy as possible.

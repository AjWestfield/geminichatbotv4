# Auto Aspect Ratio Detection for Image Editing

## Problem
When editing uploaded images, the edited result doesn't maintain the same aspect ratio as the original image. From the screenshots:
- Original image: Portrait orientation (Inspector Gadget cartoon)
- Edited image: Landscape orientation with black bars

## Analysis

The system already has aspect ratio detection implemented:

1. **Aspect Ratio Detection** (`/lib/image-utils.ts`):
   - `getImageAspectRatio()` function detects image dimensions
   - Returns appropriate `imageSize` for OpenAI API: '1024x1024', '1792x1024', or '1024x1792'

2. **Upload Flow** (`/components/chat-interface.tsx`):
   - Line 771: Detects aspect ratio when image is uploaded
   - Line 1161: Uses detected aspect ratio when creating GeneratedImage for editing

3. **Edit API** (`/app/api/edit-image/route.ts`):
   - Correctly validates and uses the size parameter
   - Supports square (1024x1024), landscape (1536x1024), and portrait (1024x1536)

## Issue Found

The API route uses different size values than what the frontend detects:
- Frontend detection: '1792x1024' (landscape), '1024x1792' (portrait)
- API validation: '1536x1024' (landscape), '1024x1536' (portrait)

This mismatch causes the API to default to 1024x1024 (square) when it receives an invalid size.

## Solution

Update the `getImageAspectRatio` function to return OpenAI-compatible sizes.

## Implementation

### 1. Updated image-utils.ts
```typescript
// Updated getImageAspectRatio to use OpenAI-compatible sizes
imageSize: '1536x1024' // landscape (was 1792x1024)
imageSize: '1024x1536' // portrait (was 1024x1792)
```

### 2. Updated TypeScript types
- Updated return type of `getImageAspectRatio`
- Updated `FileUpload` interface in chat-interface.tsx

### 3. Enhanced logging
Added detailed logging to track aspect ratio detection and usage:
- Logs detected dimensions and orientation when image is uploaded
- Logs the size being used when creating image for editing
- Logs the size parameter in the edit modal

## Testing Instructions

1. Upload a portrait image (taller than wide)
   - Should detect as portrait orientation
   - Should use size '1024x1536'
   
2. Upload a landscape image (wider than tall)
   - Should detect as landscape orientation
   - Should use size '1536x1024'
   
3. Upload a square image
   - Should detect as square orientation
   - Should use size '1024x1024'

4. Click "Edit" on any uploaded image
   - Check console logs for detected aspect ratio
   - Edit the image with any prompt
   - Verify the edited result maintains the same aspect ratio as the original

## Result

The edited images will now maintain the same aspect ratio as the original uploaded images, preventing the black bars issue shown in the screenshots.

echo "ðŸ”§ Testing Edited Image Persistence Fix"
echo "======================================"
echo ""
echo "This test verifies that edited images persist after page refresh."
echo ""
echo "Prerequisites:"
echo "1. Ensure you have made the fix to lib/image-utils.ts"
echo "2. Start the dev server: npm run dev"
echo "3. Open http://localhost:3000"
echo ""
echo "Test Steps:"
echo "-----------"
echo ""
echo "1. Generate a test image:"
echo "   Type: 'Generate an image of a beautiful sunset'"
echo ""
echo "2. Edit the image:"
echo "   - Click on the generated image"
echo "   - Click the 'Edit' button"
echo "   - Enter: 'Add birds flying across the sky'"
echo "   - Click 'Start Edit'"
echo "   - Wait for completion"
echo ""
echo "3. Check localStorage (F12 â†’ Console):"
echo "   Run: JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('generatedImages')).filter(img => img.originalImageId)"
echo "   âœ“ Should see edited image with originalImageId field"
echo ""
echo "4. Refresh the page (F5)"
echo "   âœ“ Edited image should still be visible"
echo "   âœ“ Original image should also be present"
echo ""
echo "5. Verify in console:"
echo "   Run: JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('generatedImages')).map(img => ({id: img.id, originalImageId: img.originalImageId, model: img.model}))"
echo "   âœ“ Should see both original and edited images"
echo ""
echo "Expected Results:"
echo "-----------------"
echo "âœ“ Edited images have 'originalImageId' field in localStorage"
echo "âœ“ URLs are not truncated (especially for data URLs)"
echo "âœ“ Edited images persist after page refresh"
echo "âœ“ No duplicate images in gallery"
echo ""
echo "Common Issues:"
echo "--------------"
echo "- If edited images disappear: Check browser console for errors"
echo "- If URLs are broken: Verify the URL length fix is applied"
echo "- If originalImageId is missing: Ensure the fix is properly saved"

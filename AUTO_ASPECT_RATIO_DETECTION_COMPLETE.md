# Auto Aspect Ratio Detection - Implementation Complete

## Summary
Fixed the issue where edited images weren't maintaining the same aspect ratio as the original uploaded images.

## Changes Made

### 1. `/lib/image-utils.ts`
- Updated `getImageAspectRatio` function to return OpenAI-compatible sizes:
  - Landscape: `1536x1024` (was `1792x1024`)
  - Portrait: `1024x1536` (was `1024x1792`)
  - Square: `1024x1024` (unchanged)

### 2. `/components/chat-interface.tsx`
- Updated `FileUpload` interface to match new size values
- Enhanced logging for aspect ratio detection
- Fixed quality parameter from 'high' to 'hd'

### 3. `/components/image-edit-modal.tsx`
- Added logging to track size parameter being used

## How It Works

1. When an image is uploaded, `getImageAspectRatio()` detects its dimensions
2. Based on the aspect ratio, it assigns the appropriate OpenAI-compatible size
3. This size is stored with the file upload data
4. When editing, the stored size is passed to the edit API
5. The edited image maintains the same aspect ratio as the original

## Test Results

The fix ensures that:
- Portrait images remain portrait after editing
- Landscape images remain landscape after editing
- Square images remain square after editing
- No more black bars or aspect ratio changes

## Console Logs

When uploading and editing images, you'll see logs like:
```
Detected aspect ratio: {
  width: 768,
  height: 1024,
  ratio: 0.75,
  orientation: "portrait",
  imageSize: "1024x1536",
  videoAspectRatio: "9:16"
}
[ChatInterface] Using size: 1024x1536
[ImageEditModal] handleEdit called with image: {
  size: "1024x1536",
  ...
}
```

This confirms the aspect ratio is being properly detected and used throughout the editing flow.

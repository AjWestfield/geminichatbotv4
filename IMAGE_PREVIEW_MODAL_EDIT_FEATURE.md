# Image Preview Modal Edit Feature Implementation

## Summary
This implementation adds an edit button to the image preview modal, makes the modal more compact for better viewing, and integrates with the existing image editing functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. File Preview Modal Updates (`/components/file-preview-modal.tsx`)
- **Made modal more compact**: Changed from `max-w-5xl max-h-[90vh]` to `max-w-3xl max-h-[80vh]`
- **Constrained image size**: Added container with `max-h-[50vh]` and `object-contain` to keep images within viewport
- **Added Edit button**: New button with pencil icon that calls `onEdit` callback
- **Improved button layout**: Edit, Animate, and Download buttons now display in a clean row

### 2. Chat Message Component (`/components/chat-message.tsx`)
- **Added `onEditImage` prop**: Extended ChatMessageProps interface with optional `onEditImage` callback
- **Updated component signature**: Added `onEditImage` to destructured props
- **Passed prop to FilePreviewModal**: Connected the edit functionality from parent to modal

### 3. Chat Interface Component (`/components/chat-interface.tsx`)
- **Created `handleEditImageFromModal` handler**: 
  - Creates a temporary generated image entry
  - Adds image to the gallery
  - Switches to Images tab
  - Opens edit modal automatically
- **Connected handler to ChatMessage**: Passed handler to all ChatMessage instances

## User Experience Flow
1. User clicks on an image attachment in chat
2. Compact preview modal opens with image fitting nicely in viewport
3. User sees three buttons: Edit, Animate (if available), and Download
4. Clicking Edit:
   - Closes preview modal
   - Adds image to the Images tab in canvas view
   - Automatically opens the image edit dialog
   - User can input prompt for image modifications

## Key Features
- **Compact Design**: Modal now fits better on screen with constrained dimensions
- **Image Containment**: Images scale properly within viewport bounds
- **Seamless Integration**: Edit functionality works exactly like existing edit feature
- **Visual Feedback**: Toast notification confirms image added to gallery

## Technical Notes
- Used `object-contain` CSS to maintain aspect ratio while fitting images
- Added 100ms delay before opening edit modal to ensure smooth UI transitions
- Reused existing image editing infrastructure for consistency
- Maintained all existing functionality (animate, download) while adding edit

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Upload an image to chat
2. Click on the image attachment
3. Verify modal is compact and image fits within view
4. Click Edit button
5. Verify image appears in Images tab
6. Verify edit dialog opens automatically

# Image Model Selection Fix - Complete Solution

## Issue Summary
When selecting WaveSpeed AI (Standard) in the settings, images were still being generated with GPT-Image-1 because the quality state wasn't updating properly.

## Root Causes
1. State management issue where quality selection wasn't persisting
2. localStorage quota error preventing image storage

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed localStorage Quota Error
Modified `lib/image-utils.ts` to limit stored images:
- Keeps only the 50 most recent images by default
- Falls back to 20 images if quota is still exceeded
- Clears storage completely if errors persist

### 2. Enhanced State Management
Modified `components/chat-interface.tsx`:
- Added localStorage persistence for quality preference
- Created `updateImageQuality` wrapper function with logging
- Added window.currentImageQuality for debugging

### 3. Added Debug Logging
- Quality changes are logged to console
- API requests show the quality being sent
- Settings dialog logs current state on close

## How It Works Now

1. **State Persistence**: Your model selection is saved to localStorage
2. **On Page Load**: Loads your saved preference (defaults to HD if none)
3. **When Changing Models**: 
   - Toast notification confirms the change
   - State is updated and saved
   - Console logs track the change

## Testing Instructions

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Cmd+Shift+R
2. **Open Browser Console**: F12 → Console tab
3. **Test Model Selection**:
   ```
   a. Click settings (⚙️)
   b. Select "Standard (WaveSpeed AI)"
   c. Check console for: "Image quality changing from hd to standard"
   d. Click "Done"
   e. Generate an image
   f. Verify loading message says "Generating image with WaveSpeed AI..."
   g. Check result shows Model: "flux-dev-ultra-fast"
   ```

## Verification

Run the test script:
```bash
cd /Users/andersonwestfield/Desktop/geminichatbot
./test-quality-fix.sh
```

## Console Logs to Expect

When selecting WaveSpeed:
```
Image quality changing from hd to standard
[updateImageQuality] Changing from hd to standard
Image quality setting changed to: standard
Current image generation model: WaveSpeed AI
```

When generating with WaveSpeed:
```
Current quality setting: standard
Sending request with quality: standard
Quality value being sent to API: standard
```

## If Still Having Issues

1. **Check localStorage**:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   localStorage.getItem('imageGenerationQuality')
   ```

2. **Force Reset**:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   localStorage.clear()
   location.reload()
   ```

3. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Open DevTools → Network
   - Generate an image
   - Find request to `/api/generate-image`
   - Verify payload shows correct quality

## What Changed

1. **State Initialization**: Now loads from localStorage
2. **State Updates**: Wrapped with logging and persistence
3. **Storage Management**: Automatic cleanup to prevent quota errors
4. **Debug Helpers**: Console logs and window.currentImageQuality

The server is now running on port 3006. Your model selection should now work correctly!

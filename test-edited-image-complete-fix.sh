echo "ðŸ”§ Complete Edited Image Persistence Test"
echo "========================================"
echo ""
echo "This test verifies the complete fix for edited image persistence."
echo ""
echo "Changes Applied:"
echo "1. âœ… Edited images explicitly set isGenerating: false"
echo "2. âœ… Database save condition updated to save edited images"
echo "3. âœ… Added localStorage fallback for images"
echo "4. âœ… Proper merge of database and localStorage data"
echo "5. âœ… Prevented race conditions in gallery loading"
echo "6. âœ… Added comprehensive debugging logs"
echo ""
echo "Prerequisites:"
echo "1. Start the dev server: npm run dev"
echo "2. Open http://localhost:3000"
echo "3. Open browser DevTools Console (F12)"
echo "4. Clear console for clean test"
echo ""
echo "Test Steps:"
echo "-----------"
echo ""
echo "STEP 1: Initial Page Load"
echo "You should see these logs:"
echo "  [PAGE] Starting to load persisted images..."
echo "  [PERSISTENCE] Raw API response: {...}"
echo "  [PAGE] Database images loaded: {...}"
echo "  [PAGE] LocalStorage images loaded: {...}"
echo "  [PAGE] Combined images: {...}"
echo ""
echo "STEP 2: Generate Test Image"
echo "Type: 'Generate an image of a colorful butterfly'"
echo "Wait for completion and check logs:"
echo "  [PAGE] Processing image for save: {...}"
echo "  [PAGE] Saving image to database: {...}"
echo "  [PAGE] Image saved successfully: img_..."
echo ""
echo "STEP 3: Edit the Image"
echo "- Click on the butterfly image"
echo "- Click 'Edit' button"
echo "- Enter: 'Add flowers around the butterfly'"
echo "- Click 'Start Edit'"
echo "- Wait for completion"
echo ""
echo "Expected logs during edit:"
echo "  [ImageEditModal] handleEdit called with image: {...}"
echo "  [ImageGallery] Edit completed, adding image: {isGenerating: false, ...}"
echo "  [PAGE] Processing image for save: {isGenerating: false, originalImageId: 'img_...', ...}"
echo "  [PAGE] Saving image to database: {originalImageId: 'img_...', ...}"
echo "  [SAVE IMAGE] Successfully saved to database: {...}"
echo "  [PAGE] Image saved successfully: edited-..."
echo ""
echo "STEP 4: Verify Immediate State"
echo "In console, run these commands:"
echo ""
echo "// Check current state"
echo "console.log('=== CURRENT STATE ===')"
echo "const currentImages = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('generatedImages') || '[]');"
echo "console.table(currentImages.map(img => ({"
echo "  id: img.id.substring(0, 20) + '...',"
echo "  hasOriginalId: !!img.originalImageId,"
echo "  model: img.model"
echo "})));"
echo ""
echo "// Check edited images"
echo "const edited = currentImages.filter(img => img.originalImageId);"
echo "console.log('Edited images in localStorage:', edited.length);"
echo ""
echo "STEP 5: Refresh Page (F5)"
echo "After refresh, check console for:"
echo "  [PAGE] Starting to load persisted images..."
echo "  [PERSISTENCE] Raw API response: {hasOriginalImageId: 1, ...}"
echo "  [PAGE] Database images loaded: {edited: 1, ...}"
echo "  [PAGE] Combined images: {edited: 1, ...}"
echo ""
echo "STEP 6: Final Verification"
echo "âœ“ Both original and edited images should be visible"
echo "âœ“ Edited image should show in the gallery"
echo "âœ“ No duplicate images"
echo ""
echo "In console, verify final state:"
echo "fetch('/api/images').then(r => r.json()).then(data => {"
echo "  const dbEdited = data.images.filter(img => img.original_image_id);"
echo "  console.log('Database edited images:', dbEdited.length);"
echo "  console.log('Database edited image IDs:', dbEdited.map(img => img.id));"
echo "});"
echo ""
echo "Troubleshooting:"
echo "----------------"
echo "If edited images don't persist:"
echo "1. Check if [PERSISTENCE] logs show original_image_id in raw response"
echo "2. Check if [PAGE] Combined images shows edited > 0"
echo "3. Verify no errors in console during save"
echo "4. Check Network tab for /api/images responses"
echo ""
echo "If you see duplicates:"
echo "1. Clear localStorage: localStorage.removeItem('generatedImages')"
echo "2. Refresh and try again"
echo ""
echo "Press Ctrl+C to exit"

# HEIC Chat Display Fix ✅

## Problem
HEIC images were showing thumbnails correctly in the input preview area (after conversion), but when messages were sent, the attachments reverted to showing generic placeholder icons in the chat history.

## Root Cause
The `chat-message.tsx` component was checking if a file was HEIC format BEFORE checking if it had a valid preview URL. This meant that even though we had a converted JPEG preview, it was still showing the placeholder because the file type check came first.

## Solution
Reordered the logic in `chat-message.tsx` to:
1. First check if there's a valid preview URL (including converted HEIC data URLs)
2. Only show placeholder if there's no valid URL
3. This allows converted HEIC images to display their JPEG previews

## Code Changes

### `/components/chat-message.tsx`
```typescript
// OLD LOGIC (checked file type first)
{(attachment.contentType === 'image/heic' || 
  attachment.contentType === 'image/heif' ||
  attachment.name.toLowerCase().endsWith('.heic') ||
  attachment.name.toLowerCase().endsWith('.heif') ||
  !attachment.url || 
  attachment.url === '' ||
  attachment.url.includes('generativelanguage.googleapis.com')) ? (
  // Show placeholder
) : (
  // Show image
)}

// NEW LOGIC (checks for valid URL first)
{attachment.url && 
 attachment.url !== '' && 
 !attachment.url.includes('generativelanguage.googleapis.com') ? (
  // Show image (works for converted HEIC previews)
) : (
  // Show placeholder only if no valid URL
)}
```

### Debug Logging Added
- Chat interface logs attachment details when sending
- Chat message logs HEIC attachment info when rendering

## Testing

1. **Upload HEIC file**
   - Should see "Converting HEIC to JPEG..." 
   - Thumbnail appears in input area

2. **Send message**
   - Thumbnail should persist in chat message
   - Not revert to placeholder icon

3. **Check console**
   ```
   Pending attachment set: {...}
   Preview URL length: 54321
   Is data URL: true
   [ChatMessage] HEIC attachment: {
     name: "IMG_5718.HEIC.heic",
     hasUrl: true,
     urlLength: 54321,
     isDataUrl: true,
     hasValidUrl: true
   }
   ```

## Result
- ✅ HEIC thumbnails show in input preview
- ✅ HEIC thumbnails persist in chat messages
- ✅ "Apple format" indicator still shows
- ✅ All functionality preserved

# Image Reveal Animation Fix - Clip-Path Implementation

## What Changed

I've replaced the previous slide-down overlay animation with a modern clip-path reveal animation based on the 21st.dev component. This provides a much smoother and more reliable reveal effect.

### Key Improvements:

1. **Clip-Path Animation**
   - Uses `inset()` clip-path to reveal the image from top to bottom
   - Provides smooth, GPU-accelerated animation
   - No more overlay positioning issues

2. **Gradient Mask Effect**
   - Adds a soft edge to the reveal with gradient masking
   - Creates a more polished visual effect
   - Works consistently across browsers

3. **Simplified State Management**
   - Progress tracked as a simple percentage (0-100)
   - Clear state transitions: starting → generating → revealing → completed
   - Automatic progression based on time

4. **Better Performance**
   - Uses requestAnimationFrame (60fps updates)
   - GPU-accelerated transforms
   - Efficient clip-path updates

## How It Works

1. **Starting Phase** (1 second)
   - Shows "Getting started..."
   - Full overlay covers the image

2. **Generating Phase** (variable)
   - Shows "Creating image. May take a moment..."
   - Waits for `hasImage` prop to become true

3. **Revealing Phase** (15 seconds)
   - Shows "Image ready! Revealing..."
   - Clip-path animates from `inset(0%)` to `inset(100%)`
   - Gradient mask creates soft edge effect

4. **Completed Phase**
   - Shows "Image created."
   - Overlay fades out completely
   - Calls `onComplete` callback

## Technical Details

```tsx
// Clip-path animation
animate={{
  clipPath: loadingState === "revealing" 
    ? `inset(${progress}% 0% 0% 0%)` 
    : "inset(0% 0% 0% 0%)"
}}

// Gradient mask for soft edge
style={{
  maskImage: `linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent ${progress - 10}%, black ${progress + 5}%)`
}}
```

## Testing

1. **Generate a new image**
2. **Watch for smooth reveal** from top to bottom
3. **Check console** for any errors
4. **Verify completion** callback fires

The animation should now work smoothly and reliably!

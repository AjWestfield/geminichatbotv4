# Infinite Loop Fix Complete

## Problem
The chat interface was experiencing infinite update loops causing "Maximum update depth exceeded" React errors. The issue was in the useEffect hooks that monitor messages and update task statuses.

## Root Cause
1. **Circular Dependencies**: The useEffect hooks depended on functions (`getPlan`, `getPlanByMessageId`) that were recreated whenever the `plans` state changed
2. **State Updates in Effects**: When the effects called `updateTaskStatus`, it would update the `plans` state, causing the functions to be recreated, triggering the effect again
3. **No Deduplication**: The effects would process the same messages/tasks multiple times

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Processing Tracking Refs
```typescript
// Track processed messages to prevent infinite loops
const processedMessagesRef = useRef<Set<string>>(new Set())
const lastProcessedTaskRef = useRef<{ planId: string; taskIndex: number } | null>(null)
const processedPlanMessagesRef = useRef<Set<string>>(new Set())
const processedTaskUpdatesRef = useRef<Set<string>>(new Set())
```

### 2. Fixed useEffect for Task Auto-Updates
- Added checks to ensure messages have IDs before processing
- Track processed messages to prevent reprocessing
- Track last processed task to prevent duplicate updates
- Clear tracking state when plan is completed

### 3. Fixed useEffect for Plan Creation
- Check if message has already been processed for plan creation
- Track processed task updates with unique keys
- Prevent duplicate plan creation and task updates

### 4. Stabilized Hook Functions
In `use-agent-plan.ts`:
- Added `plansRef` to maintain stable reference to plans
- Modified `getPlan` and `getPlanByMessageId` to use the ref instead of state
- Removed `plans` from dependency arrays to prevent recreation

## Files Modified
1. `/components/chat-interface.tsx` - Added tracking refs and guards in useEffects
2. `/hooks/use-agent-plan.ts` - Stabilized function references using refs

## Testing
Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
./test-infinite-loop-fix.sh
```

The fix ensures that:
- Each message is only processed once for plan creation
- Each tool completion only triggers one task update
- No infinite loops occur when updating task statuses
- React rendering remains stable without "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors

# Video Generation Fix Complete

## Summary

Fixed the issue where the AI agent would say "I cannot create videos" when asked to generate videos. The agent now recognizes video generation requests and can trigger video generation using the Replicate API.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated System Prompts (`/lib/mcp/mcp-agent-instructions-enhanced.ts`)
- Added video generation as a core capability in the agent's system prompt
- Included detailed instructions about video models, parameters, and usage
- Added explicit instruction: "You CAN generate videos! When users ask, acknowledge their request and explain the process."

### 2. Created Video Generation Handler (`/lib/video-generation-handler.ts`)
- Detects video generation requests from natural language
- Parses parameters like duration, aspect ratio, and model preference
- Distinguishes between text-to-video and image-to-video requests
- Generates appropriate responses for each type

### 3. Updated Chat Route (`/app/api/chat/route.ts`)
- Added video generation detection before sending to AI model
- For text-to-video requests: Directly triggers video generation API
- For image-to-video: Instructs user to use the UI animate button
- Handles REPLICATE_API_TOKEN configuration check
- Sends VIDEO_GENERATION_STARTED event to frontend

### 4. Updated Claude Handler (`/app/api/chat/claude-handler.ts`)
- Added full agent instructions to system prompt
- Added video generation detection for Claude model

### 5. Updated Claude Streaming Handler (`/lib/claude-streaming-handler.ts`)
- Added video generation trigger detection in streamed responses
- Triggers actual video generation when detected
- Sends video events to frontend

## How It Works Now

1. **User Request**: "Create a video of a woman walking her dog down the street"

2. **Detection**: The system detects this as a text-to-video request

3. **API Call**: If REPLICATE_API_TOKEN is configured, it calls `/api/generate-video`

4. **Response**: The agent responds with:
   - Confirmation that video is being generated
   - Details about the video (model, duration, aspect ratio)
   - Information about where the video will appear (Video tab)
   - Generation status and ID

5. **Frontend Integration**: The VIDEO_GENERATION_STARTED event can be handled by the frontend to:
   - Show progress in the Video tab
   - Poll for completion
   - Display the finished video

## Video Request Patterns Supported

- "generate/create/make a video of..."
- "produce a video showing..."
- "can you generate a video..."
- "video of..."
- "animate this image" (for image-to-video)
- Duration: "10 second video" → 10s
- Aspect ratio: "vertical/portrait" → 9:16, "square" → 1:1
- Quality: "high quality/pro" → Pro model

## Configuration Required

Add to `.env.local`:
```
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_api_token
```

Without this token, the agent will inform users how to set up video generation.

## Next Steps

The frontend needs to handle the VIDEO_GENERATION_STARTED event to:
1. Add the video to the generation queue
2. Poll the `/api/generate-video?id={id}` endpoint for status
3. Display the completed video in the Video gallery

The implementation ensures the agent now properly recognizes and handles video generation requests instead of saying it cannot create videos.

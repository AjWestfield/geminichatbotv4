# MCP Tool Display - Implementation Complete ✅

## Summary of Changes

I've fixed the MCP tool display to show compact, collapsible results instead of raw JSON. Here's what's been implemented:

### 1. **Tool Result Parsing**
- Extracts tool execution results from message content
- Removes all tool-related text from the displayed message
- Stores results in structured format for display

### 2. **Clean Message Display**
- Only shows the AI's analysis and response
- All tool execution details are hidden
- No more JSON dumps in the chat

### 3. **Collapsible Components**
- **During execution**: Shows animated loading state
- **After completion**: Shows collapsible result card with:
  - Tool and server name
  - Success/failure status
  - Timestamp and duration
  - Preview in collapsed state
  - Full results when expanded
  - Copy button functionality

### 4. **AI Analysis**
- Automatically analyzes tool results
- Provides insights and answers based on data
- Seamless integration with conversation flow

## How to Test

1. Start the dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Try these prompts:
- "Use the exa tool to search for latest AI news"
- "Search for information about React hooks"

3. You should see:
- ✅ Loading animation while tool executes
- ✅ Clean message with only AI's analysis
- ✅ Collapsible card with tool results
- ✅ Professional, organized display

## What It Looks Like Now

**Before**: Raw JSON and tool execution details cluttering the chat
**After**: Clean AI response with expandable tool results below

The implementation provides a much better user experience with organized, professional display of MCP tool results!

# MCP Tool Display - Final Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Tool Result Components**
- `MCPToolResult`: Collapsible card for displaying tool results
- `MCPToolAnimation`: Loading animation during tool execution

### 2. **Enhanced Parsing** (`hooks/use-chat-with-tools.ts`)
- Extracts tool calls from message content
- Parses tool execution results
- Strips all tool-related content from displayed messages
- Only shows AI's analysis in the chat

### 3. **Clean Display**
- Tool results appear in collapsible cards below messages
- No more raw JSON in chat
- Professional, organized interface

### 4. **AI Analysis**
- After tool execution, AI automatically analyzes results
- Provides insights and answers based on retrieved data

## üß™ Testing Steps

1. **Start the server**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. **Open browser console** to see debug logs

3. **Test with these prompts**:
- "Use the exa mcp to get the latest news in ai"
- "Search for React documentation"

4. **Look for**:
- Console logs: `[stripToolCallsFromContent]` showing content cleaning
- Console logs: `[parseToolCallsFromContent]` showing result extraction
- Loading animation while tool executes
- Collapsible result card after completion
- Clean AI message with only the analysis

## üîç Debugging

If results still show as raw JSON:

1. **Check console for errors** - Look for JSON parsing errors
2. **Verify tool format** - Ensure AI is using correct [TOOL_CALL] format
3. **Check server logs** - Ensure tool is executing properly

## üìù Expected Behavior

**What you type**: "Use the exa mcp to get the latest news in ai"

**What you see**:
1. Your message appears
2. AI responds with intent to search
3. Loading animation appears (tool executing)
4. Collapsible result card appears with tool results
5. AI provides analysis of the news found

**Message content**: Only shows AI's analysis, no JSON or tool execution details

The implementation is complete and should provide a clean, professional display of MCP tool results!

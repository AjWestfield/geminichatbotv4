# Infinite Loop Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing a "Maximum update depth exceeded" error caused by an infinite loop in the React component state updates. The error was occurring in the Radix UI presence/animation components when the agent plan auto-update logic was triggering continuous re-renders.

## Root Cause
The infinite loop was caused by:

1. **Circular Dependencies**: The useEffect watching messages was updating task statuses, which could trigger message updates, causing the effect to run again
2. **Unstable Function References**: Functions in the `useAgentPlan` hook were recreated on every render because they depended on the `plans` state
3. **Missing Deduplication**: Same messages and plans were being processed multiple times

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Processing Tracking (chat-interface.tsx)
```javascript
const processedMessagesRef = useRef<Set<string>>(new Set())
const lastProcessedTaskRef = useRef<string | null>(null)
```
- Track which messages have been processed to prevent duplicates
- Track the last processed task to avoid redundant updates

### 2. Modified useEffects with Guards
- Added checks to skip already-processed messages
- Clear tracking state when tasks complete
- Prevent processing the same task multiple times

### 3. Stabilized Hook Functions (use-agent-plan.ts)
```javascript
const plansRef = useRef<Map<string, AgentPlan>>(new Map())
```
- Added a ref to maintain stable reference to plans
- Modified `getPlan` and `getPlanByMessageId` to use the ref
- Removed `plans` from dependency arrays

## Results
✅ No more infinite loop errors
✅ Agent plans still update automatically
✅ Task progression works correctly
✅ App performance improved

## How It Works Now
1. When a new message arrives, it's checked against the processed set
2. If not processed, the plan/task updates are applied
3. The message ID is added to the processed set
4. Functions maintain stable references, preventing unnecessary re-renders
5. Animation components no longer trigger infinite updates

## Testing
The fix has been tested and the development server runs without errors. The agent plan system continues to function correctly with automatic task progression.

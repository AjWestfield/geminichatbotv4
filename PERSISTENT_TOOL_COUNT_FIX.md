# Persistent MCP Tool Count Fix âœ…

## Problem Fixed
The MCP tool count was displaying "0 enabled" even when servers were enabled, especially after browser refresh. The tool count wasn't persisting or updating correctly when servers were connecting.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Connection Dependency**: Tool count only included tools from `connected` servers, not `enabled` servers
2. **No Auto-Connect**: Enabled servers weren't automatically connecting on app startup
3. **State Sync Issue**: The persisted state (enabled servers) wasn't triggering actual connections
4. **Timing Problem**: Tool count calculated before servers had a chance to connect

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Auto-Connect on Startup (`hooks/use-mcp-initialization.ts`)
```typescript
// Auto-connect enabled servers on startup
useEffect(() => {
  const connectEnabledServers = async () => {
    for (const server of servers) {
      if (isEnabled && server.status === 'disconnected') {
        await connectServer(server.id)
      }
    }
  }
  // Runs once when servers are initialized
}, [hasInitialized.current, servers.length])
```

### 2. Enhanced Tool Count Calculation (`components/mcp/mcp-tools-popup.tsx`)
```typescript
const { totalEnabledTools, isConnecting, potentialTools } = useMemo(() => {
  // Count tools from connected servers
  // Count potential tools from enabled but not-yet-connected servers
  // Track if any servers are connecting
})
```

### 3. Auto-Connect on Popup Open
```typescript
// Also connects enabled servers when popup opens
if (open && servers.length > 0) {
  connectEnabledServers()
}
```

## Behavior Changes

### Before Fix:
- Tool count showed "0 enabled" on initial load
- Servers stayed disconnected even if enabled
- Count only updated after manual connection
- State didn't persist properly across refreshes

### After Fix:
- Tool count shows correct number immediately
- Enabled servers auto-connect on startup
- Shows "X enabled (connecting...)" during connection
- Includes potential tools from enabled servers
- State persists across browser refreshes

## Testing

1. **Initial Load**: Tool count shows correct number based on enabled servers
2. **Toggle Servers**: Count updates when enabling/disabling servers
3. **Browser Refresh**: 
   - Enabled state persists
   - Servers auto-connect
   - Tool count shows correctly
4. **Connection Status**: Shows "(connecting...)" while servers connect

## Technical Details

- **Persistence**: Uses Zustand with localStorage adapter
- **State Management**: Separate enabled/connected states
- **Reactive Updates**: Tool count updates as servers connect
- **Graceful Degradation**: Shows potential tools even before connection

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Users see tool count right away
2. **Clear Status**: "(connecting...)" indicator shows progress
3. **Consistent State**: Settings persist across sessions
4. **No Manual Steps**: Servers connect automatically when enabled

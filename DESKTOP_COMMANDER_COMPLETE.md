# DesktopCommander Fix Complete ‚úÖ

## What Was Fixed

### 1. NPM Cache Issue
- **Problem**: NPM cache corruption preventing DesktopCommander installation
- **Solution**: Created `fix-desktop-commander.sh` script to clear NPM cache
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

### 2. Connection State Management
- **Problem**: Connection dropping immediately but status showing "connected"
- **Solution**: Enhanced MCPClientWrapper with:
  - Connection health monitoring
  - Proper state tracking
  - Graceful cleanup of dead connections
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

### 3. Retry Logic
- **Problem**: Single connection attempt with no recovery
- **Solution**: Added intelligent retry mechanism:
  - Up to 3 retry attempts
  - Progressive delays (2-3 seconds)
  - Error pattern matching
  - Special handling for DesktopCommander
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

## Files Modified
1. `lib/mcp/mcp-client.ts` - Enhanced connection management
2. `lib/mcp/mcp-server-manager.ts` - Added retry logic
3. `fix-desktop-commander.sh` - NPM cache cleanup script
4. `test-desktop-commander-fix.sh` - Testing instructions

## How to Test
1. Run `./fix-desktop-commander.sh` if you haven't already
2. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:3000
4. Click the MCP Tools icon (‚öôÔ∏è)
5. Enable DesktopCommander
6. Connection should succeed (may retry 1-2 times)

## Expected Behavior
- No more NPM cache errors
- No more "Client not connected" errors  
- Automatic retry on connection failures
- Stable connection once established
- Tools should appear after successful connection

## If Issues Persist
- Check browser console for detailed logs
- Connection attempts are logged with retry count
- Each retry waits progressively longer
- Maximum 3 connection attempts

The DesktopCommander MCP server should now connect reliably! üéâ

# MCP Tool Awareness Fix Summary

## The Problem
The MCP servers were connecting successfully but the AI agent wasn't aware of the available tools. The root cause was that server connection state wasn't persisting between different API calls in Next.js.

## The Solution
Implemented a **just-in-time connection** approach where servers connect automatically when tools are requested.

### Key Changes:

1. **Modified `/lib/mcp/mcp-tools-context.ts`**:
   - Auto-connects to disconnected servers when `getAvailableTools()` is called
   - Ensures tools are always available when needed
   - No reliance on pre-existing connections

2. **Simplified `/app/api/chat/route.ts`**:
   - Removed complex initialization logic
   - Relies on MCPToolsContext to handle connections

3. **Updated `/app/api/mcp/init/route.ts`**:
   - Only loads configurations without connecting
   - Returns server info for UI display

## How It Works Now:

1. When a chat request comes in, it calls `MCPToolsContext.getAvailableTools()`
2. This method checks each configured server's status
3. If a server is disconnected, it automatically connects it
4. Tools are fetched from connected servers
5. A system prompt is generated with all available tools
6. The AI receives the tools in its context and can use them

## Testing:

```bash
# Run the dev server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run the test script
./test-mcp-tools.sh

# Or check server status
./debug-mcp-status.sh
```

## Example Queries That Should Work:

- "Tell me about the React library"
- "What is Express.js?"
- "Show me documentation for Vue.js"

The AI will automatically use the context7 tools to fetch relevant documentation.

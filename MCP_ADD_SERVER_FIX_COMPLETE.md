# MCP Add Server Fix Complete âœ…

## Problem Fixed
The agent was trying to use non-existent MCP tools (`github-analyze` and `mcp_add_server`) on a server called "mcp" which doesn't exist. This caused the error: "Server 'mcp' not found or not connected".

## Root Cause
The chat route was instructing the agent to use API endpoints as if they were MCP tools, causing confusion between:
- Real MCP tools (from connected servers like Context7, Exa)
- API endpoints (like /api/mcp/github-analyze)

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Chat Route Instructions
- Removed misleading prompts about using non-existent tools
- Agent no longer tries to call `github-analyze` or `mcp_add_server` as MCP tools

### 2. Added Automatic GitHub Analysis
- When agent searches for MCP server info using web_search_exa
- If results contain GitHub repository info, automatically analyzes and configures the server
- No manual tool calls needed - happens seamlessly

### 3. Added Sequential Thinking to Known Servers
- Added to the known servers list for direct installation
- Can be added with: "add sequential thinking server"

## How It Works Now

### For GitHub URLs:
1. User: "Add this mcp server https://github.com/..."
2. Agent uses web_search_exa to find information
3. System automatically analyzes results and configures server
4. Success message shown to user

### For Known Servers:
1. User: "Add sequential thinking server"
2. System recognizes known server name
3. Automatically configures with correct npx command
4. Success message shown to user

### For Unknown Servers:
1. User: "Add XYZ mcp server"
2. Agent searches for configuration
3. If found, automatically configures
4. If not found, asks for more info

## Test Commands

```bash
# Direct known server
"Add sequential thinking server"

# GitHub URL
"Add this mcp server https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/sequentialthinking"

# Natural language
"I want to add the filesystem MCP server"
```

## Benefits
- No more confusing error messages
- Seamless server addition process
- Works with both direct names and GitHub URLs
- Automatic configuration without manual steps

# HEIC Image Upload Error Fix Complete ✅

## Problem
When uploading HEIC images (common iPhone photo format), the app was throwing an error:
```
Error: Failed to load image for aspect ratio detection
    at img.onerror (webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./lib/image-utils.ts:416:20)
```

## Root Cause
1. HEIC images upload successfully to Gemini and get a URI like `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/...`
2. These Gemini URIs cannot be loaded in browser `<img>` tags due to CORS/authentication
3. The `getAspectRatioDetectionReason` function was trying to load the image and throwing an error when it failed

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Updated `getImageAspectRatio` function** ✅
- Added special handling for HEIC/HEIF files
- Returns default landscape dimensions (4032×3024) for HEIC files
- Falls back to default values instead of throwing errors

### 2. **Fixed `getAspectRatioDetectionReason` function** ✅
- Changed `img.onerror = reject` to `img.onerror = () => resolve(null)`
- Added check for images that fail to load (width/height = 0)
- Returns appropriate fallback message instead of throwing error

### 3. **Already had Gemini URI detection** ✅
- Both functions check for Gemini URIs and handle them specially
- Returns "HEIC/HEIF image → 16:9 (default for Apple formats)" for Gemini URIs

## Code Changes

### `/lib/image-utils.ts`
```typescript
// In getAspectRatioDetectionReason:
img.onerror = () => {
  console.warn('Image failed to load in getAspectRatioDetectionReason, using fallback')
  resolve(null) // Resolve instead of reject
}

// Added check for failed image load:
if (width === 0 || height === 0) {
  return `Auto-detected → ${detectedRatio} (unable to load image)`
}
```

## Result
- ✅ HEIC images upload without errors
- ✅ Aspect ratio detection falls back gracefully
- ✅ Animation modal works with HEIC images
- ✅ No more console errors when uploading iPhone photos

## Test It
1. Upload a HEIC image (from iPhone)
2. Image should upload successfully
3. Click "Animate" on the image
4. Modal should open without errors
5. Aspect ratio should show as "HEIC/HEIF image → 16:9 (default for Apple formats)"

echo "üìã Implementation Checklist:"
echo ""
echo "1. ‚úÖ Secure API Key Component"
echo "   - Created secure-api-key-input.tsx"
echo "   - Modal with show/hide password"
echo "   - Instructions for obtaining keys"
echo ""
echo "2. ‚úÖ Enhanced Agent Instructions"
echo "   - Detailed MCP management workflow"
echo "   - Tool awareness (Context7, Exa, DesktopCommander)"
echo "   - API key handling protocol"
echo ""
echo "3. ‚úÖ Chat Interface Updates"
echo "   - Detects REQUEST_API_KEY from AI"
echo "   - Shows secure input dialog"
echo "   - Sends API_KEY_PROVIDED back to AI"
echo "   - Filters protocol messages from display"
echo ""
echo "4. ‚úÖ Configuration File Path"
echo "   - Path: /Users/andersonwestfield/Desktop/geminichatbotv3/mcp.config.json"
echo "   - AI knows exact location"
echo "   - Uses DesktopCommander to modify"
echo ""

echo "üß™ Test Scenarios:"
echo ""
echo "‚≠ê NEW ENHANCEMENT - Automatic Search:"
echo "   üí¨ 'I want to add the sequential thinking mcp server'"
echo "   Expected: AI immediately says 'Let me search...' and finds config"
echo "   NOT: AI should NOT ask for configuration details!"
echo ""
echo "1. Test adding server WITH API key:"
echo "   üí¨ 'Add the GitHub MCP server'"
echo "   Expected: AI searches, detects GITHUB_TOKEN need, shows secure dialog"
echo ""
echo "2. Test adding server WITHOUT API key:"
echo "   üí¨ 'Add filesystem MCP for my Documents folder'"
echo "   Expected: AI adds directly without API key prompt"
echo ""
echo "3. Test GitHub repository:"
echo "   üí¨ 'Add https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/server-slack'"
echo "   Expected: AI analyzes repo, finds config, handles API key"
echo ""
echo "4. Test unknown server:"
echo "   üí¨ 'Add the quantum computing MCP server'"
echo "   Expected: AI searches but explains if not found"
echo ""

echo "‚ö° Quick Verification:"
echo "1. Open http://localhost:3000"
echo "2. Make sure these MCP servers are enabled:"
echo "   - Context7 or Exa (for searching)"
echo "   - DesktopCommander (for file operations)"
echo "3. Try one of the test scenarios above"
echo "4. Check if secure dialog appears when needed"
echo "5. Verify server is added to mcp.config.json"
echo ""

echo "üìù Notes:"
echo "- REQUEST_API_KEY and API_KEY_PROVIDED messages are hidden from chat"
echo "- API keys are masked in chat (e.g., sk-‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢1234)"
echo "- The AI will provide links to obtain API keys"
echo "- Config file is automatically updated"

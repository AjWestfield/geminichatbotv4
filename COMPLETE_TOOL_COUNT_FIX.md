# Complete Tool Count Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Initial Tool Count Shows 0
**Problem**: Connected servers showed "0 enabled" until manually toggled
**Solution**: Added explicit `setServerEnabled(true)` for connected servers during initialization

### 2. Badge Not Appearing
**Problem**: Tool count badge on icon didn't show on initial load
**Solution**: Ensured enabled state is set when servers are connected

## Implementation Details

### Key Change in `/hooks/use-mcp-initialization.ts`
```typescript
// If server is connected, it should be enabled
if (server.status === 'connected') {
  mcpState.setServerEnabled(server.id, true)
}
```

This simple addition ensures:
- Connected servers are always marked as enabled
- Tool counts calculate correctly from the start
- No manual toggle required to see counts

## How It Works

1. **Server Connects** → Automatically marked as enabled
2. **State Updates** → Tool count recalculates
3. **UI Updates** → Badge and popup show correct counts

## Visual Indicators

### Tools Icon Badge
- Shows total enabled tools count
- Blue badge with white text
- Only appears when count > 0

### Popup Header
- Shows "X enabled" where X is total tool count
- Updates in real-time as servers toggle

### Server Rows
- Shows "X/Y" format (enabled/total tools)
- Individual tool counts per server

## Test the Fix
```bash
./test-initial-tool-count.sh
```

## Expected Results
- ✅ Tool count shows immediately on load
- ✅ No toggle required to see initial count
- ✅ Connected servers = enabled servers
- ✅ Counts persist across refreshes

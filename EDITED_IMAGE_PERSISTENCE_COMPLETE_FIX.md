# Complete Fix for Edited Image Persistence

## Problem Summary
Edited images were not persisting after browser refresh. They would appear immediately after editing but disappear on page reload.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing `isGenerating: false`** - Edited images weren't explicitly marked as complete
2. **Save condition too restrictive** - Only saved images with `!isGenerating`, excluding edited images
3. **No localStorage fallback** - Unlike videos, images only loaded from database
4. **Race condition** - Gallery component and page component both trying to load images
5. **No merge logic** - Database and localStorage data weren't properly combined

## Complete Solution

### 1. Fixed Image Creation (`components/image-edit-modal.tsx`)
```typescript
const editedImage: GeneratedImage = {
  // ... other fields
  originalImageId: originalImage.id,
  isGenerating: false, // Explicitly mark as complete
}
```

### 2. Updated Save Condition (`app/page.tsx`)
```typescript
// Save if: image is complete OR it's an edited image
if (image && (!image.isGenerating || image.originalImageId)) {
  // Save to database...
}
```

### 3. Added localStorage Fallback (`app/page.tsx`)
```typescript
// Load from database
const dbImages = await loadAllImages()

// Load from localStorage as backup
const localImages = loadGeneratedImages()

// Combine and deduplicate - prefer database version
const imageMap = new Map<string, GeneratedImage>()
localImages.forEach(img => imageMap.set(img.id, img))
dbImages.forEach(img => imageMap.set(img.id, img)) // Override with DB

const combinedImages = Array.from(imageMap.values())
```

### 4. Prevented Race Condition (`components/image-gallery.tsx`)
```typescript
// Disabled localStorage loading in gallery to prevent interference
// All loading now happens in page.tsx with proper merge logic
```

### 5. Added Comprehensive Debugging
- Database load logging shows edited image counts
- localStorage load logging for comparison
- Save process logging with isGenerating status
- API response logging to verify data integrity

### 6. Marked Loaded Images as Saved
```typescript
// Prevent re-saving images that are already in database
dbImages.forEach(img => {
  savedImageIdsRef.current.add(img.id)
})
```

## Data Flow

### Save Flow:
1. User edits image → `performImageEdit()` creates edited image with `isGenerating: false`
2. Gallery updates → `handleEditComplete()` triggers `onImagesChange`
3. Page component → `handleGeneratedImagesChange()` saves to database
4. Save condition passes because image has `originalImageId`
5. Image saved to both database and localStorage

### Load Flow:
1. Page loads → `loadPersistedImages()` runs
2. Load from database → Gets all images including edited ones
3. Load from localStorage → Gets backup data
4. Merge data → Database takes precedence
5. Update state → Combined images shown in gallery
6. Mark as saved → Prevent duplicate saves

## Verification

### Console Logs to Monitor:
```
[PAGE] Starting to load persisted images...
[PERSISTENCE] Raw API response: {hasOriginalImageId: 1, ...}
[PAGE] Database images loaded: {edited: 1, ...}
[PAGE] LocalStorage images loaded: {edited: 1, ...}
[PAGE] Combined images: {edited: 1, ...}
```

### Quick Diagnostics:
```javascript
// Run diagnose-edited-images.js in console
// Or use these commands:

// Check localStorage
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('generatedImages')).filter(img => img.originalImageId)

// Check database
fetch('/api/images').then(r => r.json()).then(data => {
  console.log('DB edited:', data.images.filter(img => img.original_image_id))
})
```

## Testing

1. Generate an image
2. Edit the image
3. Verify save logs show `isGenerating: false`
4. Refresh the page
5. Verify edited image persists

## Files Modified

1. `/components/image-edit-modal.tsx` - Set isGenerating: false
2. `/app/page.tsx` - Complete rewrite of image loading with merge logic
3. `/components/image-gallery.tsx` - Disabled conflicting localStorage load
4. `/hooks/use-chat-persistence.ts` - Added debugging logs
5. `/lib/image-utils.ts` - Fixed localStorage field preservation (previous fix)

## Key Improvements

- **Robust loading** - Combines database and localStorage data
- **No data loss** - Fallback ensures images persist even if one storage fails
- **Clear debugging** - Comprehensive logs at every step
- **No duplicates** - Proper deduplication and saved tracking
- **Performance** - Images marked as saved to prevent redundant API calls

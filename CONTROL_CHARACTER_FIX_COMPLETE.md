# Control Character JSON Parsing Fix - Complete ✅

## Problem
The error "Bad control character in string literal in JSON at position 732" was occurring when parsing web search results containing special characters like tabs, newlines, and other control characters.

## Root Cause
The escape/unescape logic was overly complex and incorrect:
1. We were trying to escape control characters that JSON.stringify already handles
2. We were converting escape sequences (`\t`, `\n`) to literal characters before JSON.parse
3. JSON.parse cannot handle literal control characters - they must remain as escape sequences

## Solution

### Simplified Escape Logic (`/lib/json-escape-utils.ts`)

**Before (Overcomplicated):**
```typescript
// Tried to escape everything including control characters
.replace(/\n/g, '\\n')
.replace(/\t/g, '\\t')
// ... many more replacements
```

**After (Simple & Correct):**
```typescript
export function escapeForStream(str: string): string {
  // Only escape what's needed for SSE format
  return str
    .replace(/\\/g, '\\\\')     // Backslashes first
    .replace(/"/g, '\\"');      // Quotes
}

export function unescapeFromStream(str: string): string {
  // Only unescape SSE-specific escaping
  return str
    .replace(/\\"/g, '"')       // Quotes
    .replace(/\\\\/g, '\\');    // Backslashes (must be last)
}
```

## Why This Works

1. **JSON.stringify already handles control characters**
   - Converts `\t` (tab) to `\\t`
   - Converts `\n` (newline) to `\\n`
   - Handles all other control characters

2. **We only need to escape for SSE format**
   - SSE expects: `0:"content"\n`
   - So we only escape quotes and backslashes

3. **JSON.parse handles the rest**
   - It expects escape sequences like `\t`, not literal tabs
   - Our simplified unescape preserves these sequences

## Test Results
✅ All control characters handled correctly
✅ Em dash (—) and other Unicode preserved
✅ Tabs, newlines, carriage returns work
✅ Quotes and backslashes properly escaped
✅ No more JSON parsing errors

## Key Insight
**Less is more**: By simplifying the escape logic and letting JSON.stringify/parse do their job, we eliminated the parsing errors and made the code more maintainable.

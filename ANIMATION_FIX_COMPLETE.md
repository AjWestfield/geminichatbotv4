# 🔧 Image Reveal Animation Fix Complete!

## ✅ **Problem Solved:**
The animation was stuck on "Getting started..." because it was waiting for the image URL before starting, but should have started immediately when generation began.

## 🎯 **Key Changes:**

### 1. **Separated Generation and Reveal States**
- `hasImage={true}` - Starts animation immediately when generation begins
- `imageUrl={image.url}` - Tracks when actual image is ready for reveal

### 2. **Proper State Flow**
```
1. Image generation starts → "Getting started..." (1 sec)
2. API is generating → "Creating image..." (variable time)
3. Image URL arrives → "Image ready! Revealing..." (5 sec blur reveal)
4. Animation complete → Text disappears
```

### 3. **Animation Logic**
- **Before**: Animation waited for image URL to start
- **After**: Animation starts immediately, reveal happens when URL arrives

## 📊 **How It Works Now:**

1. **Generation Phase** (no image yet):
   - Shows placeholder with generating icon
   - Text: "Getting started..." → "Creating image..."
   - No blur overlay

2. **Reveal Phase** (image ready):
   - Image loads underneath
   - Blur overlay animates from top to bottom
   - Text: "Image ready! Revealing..."
   - Smooth 5-second reveal

3. **Completion**:
   - Animation ends
   - Text disappears
   - Image fully visible

## 🧪 **Test It:**
```bash
# Quick test script
./test-animation-fix.sh
```

## 🔍 **Debug Logs:**
Watch the console for:
```
[ImageGallery] Rendering generating image: {id: "...", hasUrl: false}
[ImageGeneration] Starting generation animation
[ImageGeneration] Moved to generating state
[ImageGeneration] Image URL available, starting reveal
[ImageGeneration] Reveal complete
```

The animation now properly shows the generation progress and smoothly reveals the image when ready! 🎨

# Image Options - How to Use

## The Issue
From your screenshot, you've uploaded the image but haven't sent the message yet. The options only appear **after** you submit the message.

## How to See the Options

### Step 1: Upload Image ✅ (You've done this)
- You've successfully uploaded "1 (3).jpg"
- The image is attached and showing

### Step 2: Clear the Input Field
- Make sure the text input is **completely empty**
- Delete any text that says "What can I do for you?"

### Step 3: Press ENTER or Click Send
- With the image attached and **no text**, press Enter
- Or click the send button

### Step 4: Options Will Appear
- The AI will respond with three option buttons:
  - 🔍 Analyze Image
  - ✏️ Edit Image  
  - 🎬 Animate Image

## Visual Guide

```
Current State (Your Screenshot):
┌─────────────────────────┐

After Pressing Enter with Empty Input:

## Important Notes

1. **No Text Required**: Don't type anything - just upload and send
2. **Options in Chat**: The options appear as a response in the chat, not in the input area
3. **One Click Away**: After sending, just click the option you want

## Troubleshooting

If options don't appear after sending:
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Look for these log messages:
   - `[Chat API] Detected image upload with no text`
   - `[ChatMessage] Found IMAGE_OPTIONS marker!`
3. Make sure the dev server is running

## Debug Mode

I've added debug logging. When you send the image, check your terminal running the dev server for:
```
[Chat API] Detected media file with no text: image/jpeg
[Chat API] Detected image upload with no text - returning IMAGE_OPTIONS
```

And in browser console:
```
[ChatMessage] Found IMAGE_OPTIONS marker!
[ChatMessage] Successfully parsed image options
```

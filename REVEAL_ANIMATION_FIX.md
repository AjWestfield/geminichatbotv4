# Image Reveal Animation Fix

## Issue
The image reveal animation was getting stuck in the "revealing" state, showing a dark overlay that never completed its animation. The status text showed "Image ready! Revealing..." but the image remained mostly obscured.

## Root Causes
1. **Invalid Framer Motion values**: Was passing `"100%"` as a string to the `y` prop, which Framer Motion couldn't animate
2. **Animation not running**: The `requestAnimationFrame` loop wasn't being triggered properly
3. **Complex state management**: The previous implementation had too many edge cases and timing dependencies

## Solution
Completely rewrote the animation logic with:

### 1. Simplified State Management
- Clear state progression: `starting` → `generating` → `revealing` → `completed`
- Single source of truth for animation progress using `overlayY` state

### 2. Proper Animation Implementation
```javascript
// Use inline styles with numeric values instead of Framer Motion strings
style={{
  transform: `translateY(${overlayY}%)`,
  transition: 'transform 0.05s linear'
}}
```

### 3. Reliable Animation Loop
- Used `requestAnimationFrame` with proper cleanup
- 2-second reveal duration for smooth, consistent animation
- Progress tracked from 0-100% to move overlay down

### 4. Edge Gradient Effect
Added a gradient edge that follows the overlay for a smoother transition between the covered and revealed portions of the image.

## Key Changes

### `components/ui/ai-chat-image-generation-1.tsx`
- Replaced complex Framer Motion animation with simple CSS transforms
- Added proper animation loop with `requestAnimationFrame`
- Simplified state transitions and timing logic
- Added debug logging for troubleshooting

### `app/globals.css`
- Removed problematic animation classes
- Kept only simple fade-in animation for loaded images
- Optimized for GPU acceleration with proper CSS properties

## Testing
Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
./test-reveal-animation-fix.sh
```

## Expected Behavior
1. **Starting Phase** (1 second): Shows "Getting started..."
2. **Generating Phase**: Shows "Creating image. May take a moment..." with subtle scanning line
3. **Revealing Phase** (2 seconds): Shows "Image ready! Revealing..." as black overlay slides down
4. **Completed Phase**: Shows "Image created." with fully visible image

## Debug Logs
The console will show:
- `[ImageGeneration] Starting reveal animation` - When image URL is available
- `[ImageGeneration] Reveal animation completed` - After 2-second reveal
- `[ImageGeneration] Calling onComplete` - When updating image state

## Performance
- Uses CSS transforms for GPU acceleration
- Smooth 60fps animation with requestAnimationFrame
- Minimal re-renders with optimized state updates
- Proper cleanup on component unmount

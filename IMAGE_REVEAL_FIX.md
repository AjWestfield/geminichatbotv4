# 🎉 Image Reveal Animation Fixed!

## ✨ What's Been Fixed:

### 1. **Text Position & Size**
- ✅ Status text now appears **below** the image (was above)
- ✅ Text size reduced to `text-xs` (12px) for better uniformity
- ✅ Text is centered and doesn't break the grid layout
- ✅ Fixed height container prevents layout jumps

### 2. **Improved Animation**
- ✅ Smooth backdrop-blur reveal effect from top to bottom
- ✅ Using `inset` clip-path for smoother performance
- ✅ Soft gradient edge during reveal (10% feather)
- ✅ Text disappears completely when animation finishes

### 3. **Animation Stages**
1. **"Getting started..."** (1 second)
2. **"Creating image..."** (1 second) 
3. **"Image ready! Revealing..."** (5 seconds with blur reveal)
4. **Text disappears** (animation complete)

## 🧪 How to Test:

1. **Open the app**: http://localhost:3005
2. **Generate an image** using either model
3. **Watch the animation**:
   - Text should appear below the image placeholder
   - Image reveals smoothly from top to bottom
   - Blur effect gradually disappears
   - Text vanishes when complete

## 📊 Technical Details:

```tsx
// Improved clip-path animation
clipPath: `inset(${progress}% 0% 0% 0%)`

// Better gradient masking
maskImage: `linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent ${progress - 10}%, black ${progress + 5}%)`

// Backdrop blur for smooth reveal
className="backdrop-blur-[20px] bg-black/50"
```

## 🔍 Visual Improvements:
- No more layout jumps
- Consistent image grid alignment
- Professional reveal effect
- Subtle text animations
- Clean completion state

The animation now provides a smooth, professional image reveal experience that maintains grid uniformity! 🎨

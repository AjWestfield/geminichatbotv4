# MCP localStorage Error Fix

## Problem
When importing MCP server configurations via JSON, users were getting the error:
```
Some servers failed
context?-mcp: localStorage is not defined
```

This occurred because the server-side API was trying to access localStorage, which is only available in the browser.

## Root Cause
1. The API route `/api/mcp/servers/route.ts` was calling `serverManager.saveToLocalStorage()` which didn't exist
2. The correct method `saveToConfig()` was using `MCPConfigManagerClient` which accesses localStorage
3. This client-side config manager was being used on the server side where localStorage isn't available

## Solution
Fixed the issue in multiple files:

### 1. Fixed API Route Method Calls
- Changed `serverManager.saveToLocalStorage()` to `serverManager.saveToConfig()`
- Made the calls async with `await`

### 2. Updated Server Manager
- Made `saveToConfig()` async
- Added environment detection using `typeof window === 'undefined'`
- Uses `MCPConfigManager` (server-side) on the server
- Uses `MCPConfigManagerClient` (client-side) in the browser

### 3. Applied Same Fix Throughout
- `addServer()` method
- `removeServer()` method
- `saveToConfig()` method
- `loadFromConfig()` method

## Testing
Created test script `test-mcp-json-import-fix.sh` to verify:
- Various JSON formats work correctly
- No localStorage errors occur
- Server configurations are properly saved

## Result
The MCP JSON import now works correctly without localStorage errors. The system properly detects the environment and uses the appropriate config manager.

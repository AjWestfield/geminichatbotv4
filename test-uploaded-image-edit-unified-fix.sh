echo "3. Data URLs are properly handled in the OpenAI client"
echo "4. Uploaded images persist in gallery like created images"
echo ""
echo "Test Steps:"
echo "1. Start the development server"
echo "2. Upload an image file"
echo "3. Click 'Edit' on the uploaded image"
echo "4. Verify you see 'Edit Image with GPT-Image-1' (not 'Create New Image from Upload')"
echo "5. Enter an edit prompt (e.g., 'Make the sky purple')"
echo "6. Verify that the image is edited in-place"
echo "7. The edited image should appear in the gallery"

# Audio Transcription Fix

## Problem
When uploading audio files for transcription, users were seeing a generic error "Transcription failed: {}" without any details about what went wrong.

## Root Causes
1. **Connection Error**: OpenAI API connection was being reset (ECONNRESET error)
2. **Poor Error Handling**: Errors were only logged to console, not shown to users
3. **Missing Toast Notifications**: No user-friendly error messages were displayed

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Toast Notifications
- Imported `toast` from Sonner in `chat-interface.tsx`
- Added Sonner toast provider to `app/layout.tsx`
- Now shows specific error messages to users

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
Updated `components/chat-interface.tsx`:
```typescript
// Show user-friendly error messages based on error type
if (errorDetails.includes("Connection error")) {
  toast.error("Connection Error", {
    description: "Unable to connect to transcription service. Please check your internet connection and try again."
  })
} else if (errorDetails.includes("25MB")) {
  toast.error("File Too Large", {
    description: `Maximum file size for transcription is 25MB. Your file is ${(file.size / 1024 / 1024).toFixed(1)}MB.`
  })
} else if (errorDetails.includes("Invalid OpenAI API key")) {
  toast.error("API Key Error", {
    description: "OpenAI API key is missing or invalid. Please check your configuration."
  })
}
```

### 3. Improved API Error Detection
Updated `app/api/transcribe/route.ts`:
- Added timeout configuration (60 seconds)
- Added retry configuration (2 retries)
- Better error categorization for connection, timeout, and other errors

### 4. Better Error Messages
Now provides specific error messages for:
- Connection errors (ECONNRESET, ECONNREFUSED)
- Timeout errors
- API key issues
- File size limits
- Unsupported formats

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Connection Reset Error
**Symptoms**: ECONNRESET error when transcribing
**Possible Causes**:
- Network firewall blocking OpenAI API
- ISP or network issues
- OpenAI service temporarily down
- VPN/Proxy interference

**Solutions**:
- Check internet connection
- Try disabling VPN/proxy
- Wait and retry later
- Check OpenAI status page

### 2. API Key Issues
**Symptoms**: 401 Unauthorized error
**Solution**: 
- Verify OPENAI_API_KEY in .env.local
- Ensure API key has proper permissions
- Check API key hasn't expired

### 3. Large File Issues
**Symptoms**: File too large error
**Solution**:
- Keep audio files under 25MB
- Compress or trim audio before uploading
- Consider splitting long recordings

### 4. Timeout Issues
**Symptoms**: Request times out after 60 seconds
**Solutions**:
- Try smaller files
- Check network speed
- Retry during off-peak hours

## Testing
To test the fixes:
1. Upload an audio file (MP3, WAV, etc.)
2. Check for toast notifications on errors
3. Verify error messages are descriptive
4. Test with various file sizes and formats

## Environment Variables Required
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

## Next Steps
If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for detailed error logs
2. Verify OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
3. Test with a small audio file (< 5MB)
4. Check network connectivity to api.openai.com

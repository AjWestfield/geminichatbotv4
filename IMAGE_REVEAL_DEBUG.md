# Image Reveal Animation Debug Guide

## Issue
The image reveal animation gets stuck at "Image ready! Revealing..." and never completes.

## Debug Steps Added

1. **Console Logging**
   - Added state logging to track hasImage, loadingState, and progress
   - Progress updates logged every frame
   - Completion events logged

2. **Simplified Animation**
   - Removed opacity transitions that might interfere
   - Reduced duration to 5 seconds for faster testing
   - Cleaner state transitions

## Expected Console Output

When generating an image, you should see:
```
[ImageGeneration] State: { hasImage: false, loadingState: 'starting', progress: 0 }
[ImageGeneration] State: { hasImage: false, loadingState: 'generating', progress: 0 }
[ImageGeneration] State: { hasImage: true, loadingState: 'generating', progress: 0 }
[ImageGeneration] Starting reveal - hasImage: true
[ImageGeneration] State: { hasImage: true, loadingState: 'revealing', progress: 0 }
[ImageGeneration] Progress: 0.3%
[ImageGeneration] Progress: 0.6%
... (progress updates) ...
[ImageGeneration] Progress: 99.7%
[ImageGeneration] Progress: 100.0%
[ImageGeneration] Animation complete, setting state to completed
[ImageGeneration] State: { hasImage: true, loadingState: 'completed', progress: 100 }
[ImageGeneration] Calling onComplete callback
[ImageGallery] Animation complete for image: [id]
```

## Common Issues to Check

1. **Component Re-mounting**
   - Check if the ImageGeneration component is being unmounted/remounted
   - This would reset the animation state

2. **State Not Updating**
   - Verify hasImage becomes true when the URL is available
   - Check if loadingState transitions properly

3. **Interval Not Running**
   - Ensure the interval starts and continues running
   - Check for any errors that might stop it

## Quick Test

1. Generate a new image
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Watch the logs
4. The reveal should complete in 5 seconds

If the animation still gets stuck, check:
- Are there any JavaScript errors?
- Does the progress reach 100%?
- Is onComplete being called?

The issue is likely in one of these areas.

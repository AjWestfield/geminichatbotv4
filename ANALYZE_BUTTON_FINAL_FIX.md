# Analyze Button Final Fix

## Issue
The analyze button was not auto-submitting after populating the input field with the analysis prompt.

## Root Cause
The previous implementation was trying to interact with DOM elements directly, which wasn't working properly with React's controlled components and state management.

## Solution
Simplified the `submitWithMessage` function to:
1. Set the input value using the existing `handleInputChange` function
2. Wait 100ms for React state to update
3. Call `originalHandleSubmit` directly with a synthetic event

```typescript
const submitWithMessage = useCallback((message: string) => {
  // Set the input value
  handleInputChange({ target: { value: message } } as React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>)
  
  // We need to wait for React to update the state before submitting
  setTimeout(() => {
    // Call the wrapped handleSubmit
    const event = new Event('submit', { bubbles: true, cancelable: true }) as any
    event.preventDefault = () => {}
    originalHandleSubmit(event)
  }, 100)
}, [handleInputChange, originalHandleSubmit])
```

## Why This Works
- Uses the existing React state management flow
- Calls the same submit handler that the UI uses
- Simple timeout ensures state is updated before submission
- No complex DOM manipulation needed

## Testing
1. Upload an image
2. Click "Analyze" button
3. Should auto-populate "Analyze this image and provide a detailed analysis"
4. Should auto-submit the message
5. AI should respond with image analysis

## Status: âœ… FIXED

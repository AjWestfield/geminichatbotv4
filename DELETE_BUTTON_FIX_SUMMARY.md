# MCP Server Delete Button Fix

## Problem
Users were unable to click the delete (trash) button for MCP servers in the Settings dialog. The buttons were visible but not responding to clicks.

## Root Cause
The delete button was disabled for both:
- Servers that were connecting (`isConnecting`)
- Servers that were connected (`isConnected`)

This meant users could never delete active servers, which is overly restrictive.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified Button Logic (`/components/settings-dialog.tsx`)
**Before:**
```jsx
disabled={isConnecting || isConnected}
```

**After:**
```jsx
disabled={isConnecting}
```

Now the button is only disabled while actively connecting to prevent race conditions.

### 2. Added Confirmation Dialog
When deleting a connected server, users now see:
```
Delete connected server?
This server is currently connected. It will be disconnected before removal.
[Cancel] [Delete]
```

### 3. Enhanced User Feedback
- **Success toast**: "Server removed successfully"
- **Error toast**: Shows specific error if removal fails
- **Hover effect**: Red background on hover (`hover:bg-red-400/10`)
- **Disabled tooltip**: "Cannot delete while connecting"

## User Experience Improvements
1. ✅ Can delete connected servers (with confirmation)
2. ✅ Can delete disconnected servers
3. ❌ Cannot delete while connecting (prevents issues)
4. ✅ Clear visual feedback with hover states
5. ✅ Toast notifications for success/failure

## Testing
Run the test script:
```bash
./test-delete-button-fix.sh
```

This will guide you through verifying:
- Delete buttons are clickable
- Confirmation dialog appears for connected servers
- Servers are removed successfully
- Proper feedback is shown

## Technical Details
The backend API (`/api/mcp/manage`) already handles:
- Disconnecting connected servers before removal
- Cleaning up server resources
- Updating the configuration file

This was purely a UI restriction that was preventing proper server management.
